   abstract                      = {Over the past three decades, user stories and use cases have become increasingly dominant systems analysis and design (SA&D) requirements techniques. Both support articulating functional requirements for software projects, although they evolved within different software development approaches—user stories from agile development and use cases from traditional software engineering—and they differ significantly in terms of their grammar, syntax, and the level of detail they can capture. As such, user stories and use cases are neither synonyms nor mutually exclusive alternatives. Rather, they can and should be complementary in the systems requirements process. Unfortunately, this mix of similarities and differences—coupled with a lack of formal standards for either—make understanding and synergistically employing user stories with use cases confusing and challenging for practitioners and students alike. To address this, this paper first provides a descriptive overview of the evolution of user stories, use cases, and their interrelationship. Second, it fills a gap in the literature by providing a prescriptive, detailed approach to employing user stories and use cases together. This prescriptive approach is illustrated via a comprehensive tutorial example, providing practitioners with actionable skills and SA&D teachers and students with a new pedagogical tool.},

   abstract                      = {Mixed-methods studies are increasing in information systems research, as they deliver robust and insightful inferences combining qualitative and quantitative research. However, there is considerable divergence in conducting such studies and reporting their findings. Therefore, we aim (1) to evaluate how mixed-methods studies have developed in information systems research under the existence of heavily used guidelines and (2) to reflect on those observations in terms of potential for future research. During our review, we identified 52 mixed-methods papers and quantitatively elaborated on the adherence to the three core concepts of mixed-methods in terms of purpose, meta-inferences, and validation. Findings discover that only eight adhere to all three of them. We discuss the significance of our results for current and upcoming mixed-methods research and derive specific suggestions for authors. With our study, we contribute to mixed-methods research by showing how to leverage the insights from existing guidelines to strengthen future research and by contributing to the discussion of the legislation associated with research guidelines, in general, presenting the status quo in current literature.},

   abstract                      = {ChatGPT, an interactive, generative artificial intelligence (AI) system, was introduced in late 2022, quickly becoming one of the most rapidly adopted technologies in history. The rapid emergence of ChatGPT and similar AI tools, such as Google’s Bard, and GPT-enabled Bing from Microsoft have led to intense discussions about how they will affect various aspects of society, including higher education. Information systems (IS) education will not escape the impact of AI tools. Our goal for this paper is to develop a better understanding of the range of possible impacts of ChatGPT on IS education and to describe how IS educators might respond to these potential impacts. To that end, we discuss challenges for IS education brought on by generative AI tools, and discuss potential future scenarios based on the emergence of such tools, ranging from AI having little impact on IS education to AI serving as competition for IS educators. We examine the challenges and consequences of each scenario. We also discuss potential responses, ranging from doing nothing to embracing AI tools as legitimate learning aids. We then provide several specific recommendations that will allow IS educators to effectively respond to the rise of AI tools.},

   abstract                      = {In developing countries such as Haiti, which are marked by high unemployment and gender inequality, online education has the potential to change lives. Returns on education are particularly high in Information Communications Technology (ICT)-intensive jobs and IT outsourcing offers opportunities for remote employment, providing alternatives for economic diversification and job creation that are particularly relevant for youth and women. However, the problem faced by many developing countries, is that traditional models, frameworks, architectures, and platforms for online learning do not lend themselves well to their context and, therefore, it is important to develop context-specific platforms. This need for suitable platforms has motivated the research question that this paper seeks to address, that is: What is the appropriate architecture that supports learning strategies for delivering scalable digital skills training in a resource-constrained environment? We propose an architecture that was developed specifically for blended learning in resource-constrained environments and describe how a prototype for this was designed, built, and deployed in Haiti. The initial responses to the application of the architecture, including the testimonials of the participants and the interest expressed by other countries of the region in adopting the proposed architecture, have been extremely positive.},

Inductive empiricism, emphasizing realism and generality, represents the received view with the classic Grounded Theory Methodology as a prime example. This paper argues for openness to theory specialization in practical disciplines such as IS. Theory specialization implies sacrificing a generality of theories for their realism and precision. The distinctive attention of the paper lies in scientific idealization, sacrificing the realism of theories for their precision and generality. It has almost been completely omitted in the literature on IS theory building. The special focus of this paper lies in IT applications as a category of IT artifacts and in design-oriented theories that provide knowledge of how to design “better” IT applications. This paper illustrates its points using TAM/UTAUT research.},

We recognize security risks and present the use of a blockchain database as a representative means of securely managing and controlling an individual’s PHI.

By combining a historical review of the literature with a content analysis of 30 years of underground hacker communication, we show that hacking has evolved in three waves to embrace learning and creativity, intrusion and crime, as well as politics and cyberwarfare. We uncover a paradoxical relationship between hackers and society at large where underground hacking is considered a digital crime while at the same time inspiring and driving corporate innovation, cybersecurity, and even cyberwarfare. The outcome of our research provides a nuanced picture of the hacker underground by highlighting differences between competing discursive themes across time. Moreover, by translating these themes into a set of six contrasting personas of IS professionals, we discuss how knowledge, technologies, and creative practices of underground hackers are being professionalized. We use this discussion to provide implications and a research agenda for IS studies in cybersecurity, innovation, and cyberwarfare.},

The objective is to examine how HCT is used to monitor Covid-19’s spread, and how social factors affect individual assessment of HCT and individual compliance disposition of Covid-19 guidelines. Analyzing data collected from 360 HCT users suggests that the information and system quality of HCT indeed impact users’ assessment of its effectiveness and their compliance disposition. However, such effects are strongly mediated by social factors: peer influence and government trust can sway an individual’s cognitive judgments of Covid-19 regardless of HCT’s impacts. The findings highlight the importance of social factors in pandemic management and the need to socialize health informatics to make them more effective.},

AgriMitr developed a mobile and web application that helped farmers and other key stakeholders understand crop health, soil fertility and other critical factors related to agriculture by machine learning algorithms using satellite images. The app was a major leap of innovation in the Indian Agri-Tech space. The app was to be used majorly by farmers based in rural India, and thus the major challenge lay in spreading awareness, adoption, and usage of the app. The app, if appropriately deployed, would be an imminent milestone in sustainable food production and consumption and can aid in taking a step forward in solving the world hunger problem, an SDG of the UN. Dr. Bose was planning the strategy for AgriMitr’s mass adoption and implementation with the help of Mr. Madhav A. Ram. The much-awaited meeting with investors and key stakeholders was just one week away.

Utilizing HINTS data, this study provides empirical support for a positive relationship between the utilization of electronic personal health records (e-PHRs) and healthcare quality perceptions, albeit with a caveat that patients with greater healthcare needs as well as millennial and younger generations do not seem to enjoy the same benefits from increased use of e-PHRs. Furthermore, asynchronous patient-provider electronic communication is yet to achieve positive perceptions of better healthcare quality for most users. This research bears implications for the personalization and customization of OHMT to account for variations in patient’s healthcare needs and usage patterns.},

However, to date, there is no suitable model to guide such efforts. Existing approaches address specific applications or cover certain assessment areas but do not provide a holistic perspective. Meanwhile, research offers substantial insights into best practices for addressing wicked problems and running CI applications. This paper develops an assessment model comprising five central success dimensions for information systems that address wicked problems. Their subdimensions and associated measurement metrics allow for evidence-driven facilitation and improvement of CI applications for wicked problems. Apart from the model’s capability to improve future runs and processes, it also offers the potential to provide immediate insights for facilitation efforts during runtime. The model was validated with a platform dealing with the assessment of risks presented by global climate change. This evaluation generated strong evidence for the model’s applicability and usefulness.},

An institutional work lens is adopted to analyze the purposeful activities carried out to introduce EA in Norwegian hospitals providing a granular view on diffusion. The paper provides a rich description of the institutional work employed by the key actors involved mapping them to different turns in EA’s trajectory. Drawing from this analysis, we contribute to Information Systems literature with a conceptual model that illustrates how institutional work can mitigate the challenges of moving from the strategic-level endorsement of novelty to its diffusion and institutionalization smoothing downturns along the way. The findings indicate ways to facilitate the introduction of EA within complex organizations, providing insights for practitioners involved in EA initiatives, and advancing extant EA research through an institutional perspective.},

However, research into how the public sector uses digital innovation has been slow to develop. Government has an essential role to play in sustainability by setting and enforcing policies around subjects such as pollution and carbon taxes, making digital innovation in government critical for digital sustainability. Further, the public sector’s values and priorities differ from those of the private sector, which confounds simple comparisons in areas such as digital ways of working and efficiency drivers. This paper draws on the public management literature and uses an exploratory and interpretive field study of a leading digital government. The research identifies six barriers to digital innovation within the New South Wales government, a world-leader in digital integration. The barriers are: varying digital maturity, non-digital mindset, slow mobilization, service-based silos, premature solutioning, and failure to align investment in digital innovation with broader government priorities. The paper identifies initiatives enabling world-class digital innovation and driving effective change. These enablers are structural service integration, ecosystem engagement, technology modernization, customer-centric strategies and processes, and agility in management. This paper finds that digital capability gaps and core rigidities interact requiring a comprehensive approach to realize the significant benefits offered to citizens and the environment.},

The growing complexity of green IS in organizations needs a conceptual framework that can articulate its different impacts at various levels while taking into consideration a holistic and integrated perspective. This research focuses on how to enhance and ensure green IS-driven green performance in organizations from an operant resources hierarchy perspective. A conceptual model is proposed to examine the role of management support for green initiatives and the role of information assurance in addressing IS misuse and process automation in relationship to green IS capability and green performance. The current study tests the effects of management support as composite operant resources and information assurance as interconnected operant resources for green IS capability in enhancing and ensuring organizations’ green performance using a matched dataset of 73 organizations. We illustrate the application of the proposed conceptual model in two real-world scenarios. This study contributes theoretically by illustrating the application of the operant resources hierarchy perspective in green IS research and provides practical action suggestions for organizations adopting sustainable practices to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) deployed in agricultural decision support systems (AgriDSS) raises both hopes and concerns for increasing agricultural productivity in sustainable ways. In this paper, we conduct a scoping review to uncover the roadblocks to the use of AI-supported AgriDSS in sustainable agriculture. Based on the corpus of 121 articles, we find that the effective use of AI-supported AgriDSS is hindered at technical, social, ethical, and ecological levels. Then, drawing on the experiential learning perspective, we propose how conjoint experiential learning (CEL) can enhance sustainable agricultural practices by enhancing both AI and human learning and overcoming roadblocks in using AgriDSS. Based on this conceptual framework, we build a research agenda that suggests blind spots and possible directions for future research.},

Small-scale farmers in low-income countries are especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend heavily on rain, seasonality patterns, and known temperature ranges. Prioritizing the efforts of building climate change resilience and adaptive capacity for small-scale farmers is essential in achieving Sustainable Development Goals 13, 1, and 2. An important first step towards those efforts is to assess the climate change vulnerability among the population. We propose a Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Framework Design Framework (CCVA-DF) to guide the design of innovative digital CCVA solutions to enhance the adaptive capacity and climate change resilience of small-scale farmers. The framework outlines modern methods for vulnerability data collection and processing through Remote Sensing and GIS, advanced spatial analysis and modeling for measuring vulnerabilities, and visual analytics to support decision-making in the planning and implementation of suitable interventions. The framework is instantiated into a web application that is used by a real-world organization for transforming household resilience in Western Honduras. The CCVA-DF showcases novel measures of vulnerability using geospatial technology. It provides guidelines to design digital vulnerability assessment tools that can be used by researchers and practitioners worldwide to tackle climate change challenges.},

Information systems and information technology researchers have utilized stakeholder analysis to understand and learn from successes, failures, and other aspects of IS/IT initiatives. In this tutorial, we provide guidelines for conducting a stakeholder analysis currently missing in the IS/IT discipline despite being repeatedly called for. We reviewed studies on stakeholder analysis within IS/IT first, but found that there was not sufficient coverage. Then we went outside the discipline and found relevant studies in the areas of organizational and strategic management and public policy. Our analysis, then, consists of a review and a combination of the findings of studies from within the IS/IT discipline and studies in organizational and strategic management and public policy. Our guidelines start with determining who the stakeholders are related to a phenomenon and what key concerns these stakeholders have about the phenomenon. In the next step, we relate stakeholders to one another and across the key concerns and point out how to identify possible coalitions. Last, we describe how to apply these findings to determine strategies for managing stakeholders or building theory around a phenomenon and its concerns. These final steps can be used to make policy recommendations, provide guidance for IS/IT-related initiatives, or present constructs and relationships that can be tested by future researchers. We demonstrate the applicability of our guidelines with a case study about broadband availability in rural North Carolina.},

However, researchers have observed that IT benefits are short-lived and have called for studies on how organizations can sustain the derivation of IT benefits, especially in dynamic environments. Research shows that the integration of IT assets and other organizational resources needed to form IT-enabled resources from which organizations derive IT benefits can also constrain the renewal of IT-enabled resources to sustain the derivation of IT benefits. In this study, we draw on relevant theories, published empirical cases, and a primary case study to explore, from a structural perspective, the renewal of IT-enabled resources to sustain the derivation of IT benefits. We find that certain structural properties (i.e., component flexibility, component centrality, and component coupling) emerge during the formation and modification of IT-enabled resources and influence the renewal of IT-enabled resources. We extend Nevo and Wade’s model on the formation of IT-enabled resources with the structural properties and offer eight propositions on how the structural properties and organizational capabilities influence the renewal of IT-enabled resources. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications and identify areas for future research.},

Yet, literature on how to successfully implement, manage, and sustain digital transformations that possibly change an organization’s business model, along with its product offering, structure, and culture, is often vague and hence various assumptions can go unexamined. This panel report aggregates insights from an author development workshop on “Managing and Sustaining Digital Transformations” and provides different perspectives from six experts. Specifically, it adopts the problematization method to discuss ten commonly held assumptions regarding digital transformation and presents a research roadmap to guide digital transformation research in the future.},

In this article, we aim to show that digital teaching approaches cannot be exclusive to online teaching but should be considered important even after returning to face-to-face teaching. In particular, we focus on improving feedback in large-scale educational settings. We observe that providing and receiving appropriate feedback on learning and teaching activities is challenging independent of the specific teaching setting (in-class or online). This is particularly problematic because feedback is essential in the learning processes. To address this, we combine the concepts of learning analytics and gamification to design a lecture game app that can be used (1) to motivate students to participate in formative assessments, (2) to collect learning-related data, and (3) to analyze this data to provide instant feedback. After integrating the lecture game in different settings, we conclude that digital tools can be useful independent of the specific learning setting.},

The workshop asked what is missing from research on data in IS from four well-known scholars whose work touches upon the topic in different ways. Three main themes emerged from the speakers’ statements that were further discussed by the workshop participants: 1) the need to go beyond traditional ways of conceiving data, 2) the need to investigate the relationship between data and meaning, and 3) the need to study new data management and governance approaches. We present these research themes and connect them with future research directions.},

Namely, when preparing a paper, we recommend you (1) abstain from methodological promiscuity and (2) never overclaim (but try not to underclaim either); When submitting a paper, it is a good idea to (3) steer clear of bootlicking and (3) avoid sloppiness; and, after receiving the reviews, you should (5) forego belligerence, and (6) stop flogging a dead horse. These inversion strategies can help early career researchers better navigate the review process, increasing the chances of their papers maturing, and helping to avoid mistakes that lower the chance of publishing in high-quality IS journals.},

   abstract                      = {This study focuses on collaboration among team members in educational escape rooms in higher education. The objective of this study was to understand how collective mindfulness and less mindful behavior unfold in physical and digital game-based learning. The video data were collected from three different courses comprising 107 students on 28 teams, totaling more than 16 hours of material. The qualitative analysis revealed both collectively mindful and less mindful behaviors in team interactions. This paper contributes to collective mindfulness literature in understanding team collaboration by observing that mindfulness may be relative depending on the observation perspective. It also presents factors that affect member equality in both digital and physical escape rooms. Lastly, a nuanced description of how team collaboration occurred in a short-term problem-solving situation is developed.},

The capstone previously included no Indigenous-related content or pedagogical approaches. Indigenizing of the unit was achieved by embedding and interconnecting Tyson Yunkaporta’s (2009) 8 Ways of Indigenous Learning with the unit's content, teaching methods, and assessments, along with the Indigenous collaborative learning method Yarning Circles, in a design that could be expressed and unified in the teaching delivery to inform continuous adjustment and improvement of the unit’s curriculum, and also potentially inform the Indigenization of other UC IT units over time. A Design Science Research (DSR) methodology was put into action to evaluate the previous curriculum (as expressed in the offering of the unit), to design its Indigenized replacement, to implement it with student cohorts over two semesters, to collect data on the experience, and to reflect on the successes and challenges that arise. This methodology can also be applied reflexively in future iterative cycles of continuous adjustment and improvement of the unit’s curriculum by its conveners and colleagues to inform Indigenized designs for other units that currently have no Indigenous-related content. The extensibility of DSR is proffered as a methodological contribution to the project.},

   abstract                      = {Millions of educational videos available on YouTube offer unprecedented opportunities for online learning. As it invites open-ended and self-paced exploration of almost any topic, YouTube has emerged as an important platform for informal online learning that occurs outside the formal classroom. A considerable number of studies have been directed toward YouTube educational videos. However, research on learner engagement with YouTube educational videos is limited, despite the central role of engagement in learning and the increasing popularity of YouTube videos in informal online learning. This paper addresses this research gap. We adopt the conceptualization that learner engagement has three dimensions – behavioral, emotional, and cognitive - and investigate how the features of segmenting, signaling, and weeding (SSW), the three multimedia learning principles, in YouTube educational video presentations collectively affect learner engagement in informal online learning. Our analysis shows that different SSW features have various associations with the three dimensions of learner engagement. These findings substantiate the empirical knowledge of learner engagement with YouTube educational videos. Our study corroborates extant video engagement research and extends its relevance to informal learning on social media. It also informs video designers and developers on adding video presentation features to optimize video engagement on social media.},

To achieve this, we blended modalities (online and in-person), pedagogies (constructivist and collaborative approaches), and technologies (student-centered technologies). This resulted in a redesign that included replacing the lecture with learning resources of a digestible size and an activity-based discussion, the workshop focusing on a project for authentic problems, sense-making via doing and reflection, hybrid participation in a steady and sustainable pace, and learning communities to enable more interaction. In this paper, we share our experience and lessons that we have learned through a journey toward a student-centered approach to learning.},

More than 100 countries went into lockdown, severely affecting education systems worldwide. There was an expectation that higher education institutes would “find solutions” — and fast. Many questions arose concerning the role of online courses, technology-mediated learning resources, and the long-term effects of the pandemic on students, faculty, and institutions. Information systems educators from Southern Africa came together at the 51st Annual Conference of the Southern African Computer Lecturers’ Association (SACLA 2022). The panel reported on here was part of that conference and brought together information systems educators from three countries, South Africa, Mexico, and the United States to share their experiences and reflections regarding the effects of the COVID-19 transition and its aftermath. A wide-ranging discussion ensued, that ran the gamut from micro-level individual experiences to macro-level effects and challenges. These perspectives cover “big picture” challenges and observations, inclusion and exclusion considerations, threats and opportunities, and two reports of experiences and the resulting modifications in COVID-19 classrooms. This panel report also focused on the lessons learned from the conference attendees' discussion and suggested a possible future research agenda.},

First, we discuss some implications of the current on-demand society on higher education. Second, we provide information regarding podcasting as a method for aligning learning with students’ desires for on-demand media consumption. As part of this discussion, we demonstrate through a survey and download statistics how our low-cost initiative yielded sufficiently positive results to merit continuation. Finally, we detail the process of creating podcasts for our readers to replicate and adapt our initiative, including providing tips and discussing ways to adapt our process to other higher education courses.},

Using the action design research methodology and the responsible innovation lens, we developed a workshop enabling information systems students to form measurable reflection skills. The workshop evaluation suggests that learning took place and that students are willing to adopt responsible innovation in their future workplaces. A set of design guidelines is proposed to guide further training programs to enhance students’ ability to address complex challenges responsibly.

This teaching case is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., ChatGPT) evolution, development, and operations. The case will help students learn the origin and evolution of AI transformer models and architectures, and discusses the GiusBERTo operation and process, highlighting opportunities and challenges. GiusBERTo, Italy’s custom-AI model, offers an innovative approach that walks a tightrope between anonymizing Italy’s judicial court documents without sacrificing context or information loss. The case ends with a series of questions, challenges, and potential for LLMs in data anonymization.},

Unfortunately, people are often not able to correctly identify fake news from authentic news. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find effective mechanisms to fight fake news on social media. To this end, this paper adapts the Straub Model of Security Action Cycle to the context of combating fake news on social media. It uses the adapted framework to classify the vast literature on fake news into action cycle phases (i.e., deterrence, prevention, detection, and mitigation/remedy). Based on a systematic and inter-disciplinary review of the relevant literature, we analyze the status and the challenges in each stage of combating fake news, followed by introducing future research directions. These efforts allow the development of a holistic view of the research frontier on fighting fake news online. We conclude that this is a multidisciplinary issue, and as such, a collaborative effort from different fields is needed to effectively address this problem.},

On the one hand, many influential members of the IS community claim that much IS research follows Popper’s falsificationism. On the other hand, many assumptions underlying Popper’s falsificationism, including the nature of theories as exceptionless laws rejected by a singular unsupportive observation are inappropriate and misleading. Moreover, Popper also rejected all inductive inferences and inductive methods as unscientific which, alas, has led some influential IS scholars to dismiss inductive inferences in major IS methodologies. Such Popperian advice is harmful as virtually all statistical or qualitative IS research relies on inductive inferences – and there is nothing wrong with that. Finally, we offer a solution for how to deal with the scientific significance of the problem of induction. This solution is inductive fallibilism. This means recognizing that theories, rather than always being held as true or false simply, often contain varying inductive supportive and unsupportive evidence.},

Drawing on the notion of agility and digital infrastructures, our cross-case analysis unveils how the countries’ digital responses to the pandemic have been shaped by their national health system characteristics. In addition, we highlight how existing digital health infrastructures, regulatory adaptations, and industry collaborations fostered the alacrity with which nations responded to the pandemic. We define national-level digital agility as the ability of a nation to leverage digital infrastructure capabilities to address urgent societal challenges in a contextually appropriate way. Our key contribution is a model of this complex, but urgently needed concept containing five building blocks, that jointly explain and contribute to building such agility. Despite focusing on addressing the existing challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that researchers and policymakers can also take away from our framework ideas to tackle other socio-environmental challenges.},

Conceptual modeling is an established means for this, but it needs to be advanced to adequately depict the requirements of digitization. However, unlike the actual deployment of digital technologies in various industries, the domain of conceptual modeling itself has not yet undergone a comprehensive renewal in light of digitization. Therefore, inspired by the notion of Industry 4.0, an overarching concept for digital manufacturing, in this commentary paper, we propose Modeling 4.0 as the notion for conceptual modeling mechanisms in a digital environment. In total, 12 mechanisms of conceptual modeling are distinguished, providing ample guidance for academics and professionals interested in ensuring that modeling techniques and methods continue to fit contemporary and emerging requirements.},

Informed by employee voice research, this study adopts the revealed causal mapping method to analyze the detailed narratives of 60 workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our data analysis shows that the crowdworkers did engage in voice behaviors, but their voices were not always heard, depending on recipients. The crowdworker voice was directed to three different recipients (worker community, job requester, and platform) and influenced by six antecedents (duty orientation, efficacy judgment, workgroup identification, anger/frustration, futility, and achievement orientation). Based on the findings, we propose a model of worker voice antecedents and moderators in the CSWE. This study extends employee voice research by presenting a moderator perspective in the CSWE. Moreover, our study provides a nuanced understanding of crowdworker voice behaviors from two major aspects – antecedent and recipient – contributing to crowdsourcing research.},

This highlights the importance for researchers to critically examine digital technologies’ value inscriptions, how technology use enacts these values and the bearing of these values on research. This paper draws on the pre-ICIS 2022 IFIP 8.2 OASIS workshop on “Criticality and Values in Digital Transformation Research" to highlight four ways researchers can practice criticality, that is, how they can identify and reflect on the values that underlie digital phenomena. The types of criticality are phenomenon-based, method-based, theory-based, and self-reflexive criticality. Criticality alone does not constitute critical social research. However, criticality sensitizes researchers to consciously engage with values, which can feed into critical research’s elements of insight, critique, and transformation. Criticality can inform insight by surfacing values; providing the basis for critique by confronting readers with alternative values; and supporting transformation by proposing alternative value inscriptions. Hence, we take criticality as pivotal for understanding how digital transformation can contribute to building a better world and we invite the IS community to practice and discuss criticality, values, and reflexivity to drive positive change.},

Through the use of a virtual laboratory and home automation IoT technology, we develop a method to teach IoT in remote settings where students can experience hands-on IoT training in remote settings. We experimentally evaluate the virtual laboratory by comparing student outcomes in a traditional setting using physical materials to those using the virtual laboratory. Results indicate that while student perceptions were lower for students using the virtual laboratory, this virtual laboratory was successful in offering students the means to perform hands-on IoT automation, with these students achieving equivalent performance metrics to those utilizing a traditional physical laboratory.},

Through a meta-synthesis, an abduction and induction approach through eight methodological steps analyzed in forty-seven case studies the presence of cybersecurity capabilities to build CI. Combining theoretical and practical information security maturity models as a foundation, we understand capabilities building to improve the predictability of cyber incidents. The results evidenced four second-order dimensions to build CI named doing, enabling, improving, and managing cybersecurity, and eight first-order outcomes to represent the DCCI model. This research makes an unprecedented contribution to international and national scenarios, as it will allow firms to innovate their resource management processes and abilities to enable better cybersecurity projects and reduce the impacts of potential cyberattacks with the probability of eradicating vulnerabilities.},

They argue an increased need for and value placed on “bridgers” who can fill bridging jobs within IT. Bridgers within IT possess both technical and “soft skills” like communications/managerial and change/project management and work within the IT function but can liaise between IT and business units. Using a longitudinal sample of 1,980 IT graduates from one Information School, the data supports that IT bridgers are hired within IT, are hired earlier, and are largely hired in consulting, technology, and finance industry sectors. Contributions include exploring the utility of the macro-level categorization of NFT IT job categories to analyze job placement, the importance of tracking IT job placement in employer sectors, and the overall value of IT placement data for IT educators and administrators.},

Despite the extensive resources allocated to investigating these cases, the high volume of missing person cases constitutes one of the biggest challenges for law enforcement agencies. One approach to tackle this challenge is using crowdsourcing. That is, volunteers use freely available tools and techniques to aid the existing efforts to investigate missing person cases. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) refers to gathering information from publicly available sources and analyzing it through a comprehensive set of open-source tools to produce meaningful and actionable intelligence. OSINT has been applied to address various societal challenges and crimes, including environmental abuse, human rights violations, child exploitation, domestic violence, disasters, and locating missing people. Building on this premise, this case examines a crowdsourced initiative called Trace Labs that aims to assist law enforcement agencies in solving missing person cases using OSINT tools. The case emphasizes socio-technical aspects of cybersecurity, highlighting both the bright and dark sides of technology. It demonstrates the potential of information systems to serve the public good by examining topics such as open-source software, crowdsourcing, and intelligence gathering, while acknowledging that the very same underlying technology can be used for malicious purposes.},

In this paper, we review some of BGLMP’s key recommendations, such as the claim that all IS behavior studies that apply PMT should always use the model of the full theory, contain and measure fear, and measure actual behaviors. We defend an interpretation of Rogers (1975, 1983) that differs from the interpretation that BGLMP propose. We present evidence that Rogers’ PMT and the empirical evidence do not adequately support many of BGLMP’s suggestions and that these suggestions contradict good scientific practices (e.g., restricting the use of the method of isolation) that the philosophy of science and the original literature on PMT uphold. As a result, if reviewers and editors continue to embrace these recommendations, they could hinder the progress of IS behavior research by not allowing isolation or the combination of different theoretical components. In contrast to BGLMP’s paper, we argue that further PMT research can focus on isolated PMT components and combine them with other theories. Some of our ideas (e.g., isolation) are not PMT-specific and could be useful for IS research in general. In summary, we contest BGLMP’s recommendations and offer revised recommendations in return.},

This study systematically reviews research on the use of AR in learning settings. Our analysis of 93 relevant articles offers 21 benefits related to the learning gains and outcomes of using AR. Our study shows that the positive effects of using AR on learners’ motivation and joy have been well-studied, whereas the effects on independent learning, concentration, spontaneous learning, critical thinking, and practical skills have not yet been examined in detail. Beyond classifying and discussing the benefits of using AR in learning settings, we elaborate avenues for future studies. We specifically point to the importance of conducting long-term studies to determine the value of using AR in learning beyond the initial novelty and exploring the integration of AR with other technologies.},

IS programs differ from other computing programs in that they include highly interrelated business and technology components. This inherent interdisciplinarity is the source of its value but also one of its challenges. This paper uses the Australian higher education sector as a case study to examine overall computing degree offerings including IS offerings using the ACM/AIS curriculum models and classification of computing disciplines. We find that IS program offerings are indeed trending down and that computing offerings are dominated by Computer Science and Information Technology degrees. IS is not widely present as a “base” discipline, nor is it providing a platform for the integration of new technologies, such as AI and Cyber Security into “business” settings. To strengthen UG IS programs and perceptions, we recommend that higher education providers develop structure and processes that support interdisciplinary UG IS program development and delivery and that professional bodies and curriculum models be revised to reflect and recognize the business outcome focus of IS. These actions, together with clearer messaging around the value of IS competencies, will improve the image of IS.},

This study investigates some aspects of the role of parents’ perception of contributing to a good cause (i.e., personal mores), on their intentions to enroll their children in such a telemedicine program. Surveying parents about such a new telemedicine service that is being deployed in their school district shows that parents’ personal mores are associated with increased intentions over and above its expected time-flexibility advantages. Surprisingly, trust-increased intentions were fully mediated by those mores. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed, especially the idea that doing good to others may be another reason why people adopt telemedicine, suggesting another reason beyond the utilitarian, rational, and social processes that are portrayed in previous research.},

This case could be used in an undergraduate or graduate program in either a systems analysis and design or a capstone course. The use of this case assumes that students have a basic understanding of business requirements gathering and project scope statements.

This challenging experiential learning opportunity reinforces course concepts through their application in a realistic scenario. WRLRR has been developed using the modular design of teaching cases approach. This approach makes it possible to swap modules in and out of the case. This reduces instructor workload by making it unnecessary to develop a new case from scratch for each course iteration. It also discourages students from recycling solutions from previous courses because the case scenario has been altered. Adding or removing modules makes it possible to sufficiently vary the case study to refine the problem being addressed. Macros are provided to automate, and thereby facilitate, the insertion of modules.},

However, rapid technological development and careless use of the term mean that, in information systems (IS) research, a common understanding of smartness has not yet been established. While it is recognized that smartness encompasses more than the use of impressive information technology applications, a unified conceptualization of how smartness is manifested in IS research is lacking. To this end, we conducted a structured literature review applying techniques from Grounded Theory. We found that smartness occurs through actions, in which smart things and individuals interact, process information, and make data-based decisions that are perceived as smart. Building on these findings, we propose the concept of a 'smart action' and derive a general definition of smartness. Our findings augment knowledge about how smartness is formed, offering a new perspective on smartness. The concept of a smart action unifies and increases understanding of 'smartness' in IS research. It supports further research by providing a concept for describing, analyzing, and designing smart actions, smart devices, and smart services.},

Using practice theory, we analyzed how software professionals perceive ML development within the context of ISD models and identified themes that characterize the transformative impact of ML development on these conceptual models. Our findings show that developer-driven conceptual models, such as DevOps and MLOps, have been embraced as common frameworks for developers and management to understand and guide the ML development processes. We observed ongoing shifts in predefined developer roles, wherein developers are increasingly adopting ML techniques and tools in their professional work. Overall, our findings underscore that ML technologies are becoming increasingly prominent in software projects across industries, and that the incorporation of ML development in ISD models is an ongoing, largely practice-driven, process.},

Thus, a major criticism of maturity models is the often missing conceptual and theoretical grounding when it comes to the interpretation of the concept of maturity. To address this shortcoming, our research approach focuses on the rigorous development of a multiple-pathway maturity model. By following a sequential, theoretically grounded process, the resulting maturity model can be viewed as an instantiation of the predefined conceptual components and characteristics in a predefined domain. We present and discuss the instantiated sector and size-specific maturity model for innovation capability in small industrial firms, which is developed by applying configurational methods on a dataset and thereby offers multiple pathways to maturity. This concept of equifinality is central to our approach. It has rarely been considered in maturity model development research, although it offers the potential to build more realistic models with greater applicability, especially in domains with many interdependencies.},

Despite these significant efforts in the IS field, little has been done to investigate whether academic findings have been communicated effectively to practitioners by these disciplinary endeavors. Against this backdrop, we apply Toulmin’s argument framework to discuss two different ways to support a knowledge claim, i.e., warrant-establishing and warrant-using. We then conduct an empirical study to examine how leading academic journals in the IS field rewrite their published articles for a practitioner audience. We found two problems in these communications: First, when academic articles are rewritten as warrant-establishing arguments, scientific methods are often not included. Second, when academic articles are rewritten as warrant-using arguments, the findings are not compared to existing practices. Based on our analysis, we propose that future communication could follow a knowledge flyer style focusing on comparing academic findings with existing practices. Also, we propose a Master of Philosophy program which could be an effective pedagogical effort to educate IS practitioners.},

Four hundred participants completed a survey questionnaire to help identify methodologies in use. Additionally, participants reviewed a list of 39 specific project management tools and techniques to indicate their level of use for each of them. Our findings indicate that few project managers exclusively employ agile methodologies without the incorporation of predictive techniques and tools. Chi-square analysis was used to analyze industry, project manager experience level, and type of project to determine the influence on approach selection. The results showed that industry and type of project were important to selection, but a project manager's level of experience was not. A qualitative analysis identified two additional important factors of company policy and team experience. Overall, the study supported that there is no best approach to managing projects, but hybrid is emerging as a predominant approach to exploit the benefits of multiple approaches. Additionally, the data implies a need for greater support, resources, or education to facilitate the successful implementation and longevity of adaptive project management approaches.},

Drawing upon the screening theory, this paper examines the possibility of three breach characteristics (breach severity, breach locus, and breach controllability) and two firm attributes (CEO stock ownership, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance) serving as information screens to influence stock market reaction to a data breach incident. Using an archival dataset compiled from multiple sources, we examine 607 data breaches from 2004 to 2018 and find that the stock market reacts more negatively if a breach is more severe (i.e., involving more data records and financially sensitive consumer data), controllable (i.e., could have been prevented), and if the breached firm has weak corporate governance, as indicated by low CEO stock ownership. Furthermore, CSR provides “insurance-like” protection by attenuating the negative effects of breach severity, breach controllability, and poor corporate governance on firm value. The findings of this research highlight the relevance of screening theory as a theoretical lens for examining the contextual dependence of stock market reaction to data breaches on key breach- and firm-level characteristics.},

   abstract                      = {This panel report is based on an academic leadership panel at the 18th annual Midwest Association for Information Systems (MWAIS) 2023 conference held in St. Paul, Minnesota. A panel of five university chancellors and presidents was brought together to discuss the current and potential challenges and opportunities of higher education institutions, particularly the comprehensive regional universities in the Midwest U.S. region. The panel was asked to reflect on the challenges and opportunities afforded by the rapid use and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how this impacts higher education. Discussion themes and insights are presented along with the future outlook considerations. The panel discussed how universities are preparing themselves for broad challenges and opportunities necessitated by the rapid technological advances in AI along with other social and economic changes - such as declining state support and lower student enrollments, by reexamining the value of college education and reevaluating and repositioning curricula and programs. The discussion underscored that university leaders are placing a strong emphasis on human qualities in the human-AI dynamic. These qualities include adaptive skills for tackling unstructured problems, fostering collaboration, critical thinking, empathy, emotional intelligence, and a focus on ethical and social aspects. They highlight these attributes as vital elements, considering them more important than just the technological components when grappling with challenges posed by AI in human decision-making and higher education.},

   abstract                      = {Humans are considered “engaged” once they invest personal resources such as energy, time, or attention beyond a required level. This engagement state occurs when feeling connected to another actor or an object. In information systems (IS) research, engagement is recognized in the concept of ‘user engagement’, which has for many years successfully been employed to understand interaction patterns and user reactions. However, as IS artifacts evolve, we observe contemporary phenomena that are no longer covered by the existing concept: For one, IS have developed from passive resources (such as websites) to human-like actors (such as conversational, nowadays often large language model (LLM)-based, agents) so that a pure ‘user engagement’ perspective does not capture new affordances for engagement with active counterparts. Secondly, IS increasingly act as intermediaries into other engagement objects (e.g., organizations) that are the ultimate target of engagement. Thus, IS research may benefit from a broader perspective on engagement. Our work systematically draws on a structured literature review across adjacent academic disciplines and an in-depth qualitative analysis to develop a more comprehensive conceptual framework for engagement. With this framework, we contribute a refined and broadened conceptual base for engagement and discuss how it can inform future IS research.},

We draw upon design science research (DSR) to derive prescriptive design knowledge for VLCs as the core of our contribution. Through three DSR cycles, we conducted interviews with working students and experts, held interdisciplinary workshops with the target group, designed and evaluated two conceptual prototypes, and fully coded a VLC instantiation, which we tested with students in class. Our approach has yielded 9 design principles, 28 meta-requirements, and 33 design features centered around the value-in-interaction. These encompass Human-likeness and Dialogue Management, Proactive and Reactive Behavior, and Relationship Building on the Relationship Layer (DP1,3,4), Adaptation (DP2) on the Matching Layer, as well as Provision of Supportive Content, Fostering Learning Competencies, Motivational Environment, and Ethical Responsibility (DP5-8) on the Service Layer.},

What are the prominent definitions of social inclusion? 2) How do older adults (65 years or older) fit that definition? What are some key interpretations that placed older adults as a socially excluded group in mainstream technology? How have IT vendors included aging adults? And, what are the ways IT vendors have not included aging adults? How do you encourage vendors/software developers to consider cognitive age versus chronological age in new app development? Points of convergence and divergence among the researchers are reported and suggestions for future research addressing the inclusion of older adults in mainstream technology development are provided.},

Flow metrics such as lead time, cycle time, and touch time are used to measure, understand, and manage the flow of work. However, despite the clear focus on time in ISD flow techniques, both ISD generally and ISD flow research tend to adopt a simplistic 'clock' interpretation of time, neglecting the complex, multi-faceted, and socially embedded nature of temporality. In response, this research applies temporality theory to investigate ISD flow in six global teams, exploring concepts such as event time, synchronization, and temporal perception and personality. The study contributes to research and practice by (i) identifying the temporal characteristics of ISD flow techniques, (ii) identifying challenges associated with these temporal characteristics, (iii) providing recommendations for addressing these temporal challenges, and (iv) developing an extensive roadmap for future research to reduce the current gap in literature and practice. Although the focus is on flow techniques, the insights derived can be adapted and applied to other ISD contexts.},

Against this backdrop, we designed a novel artifact for teaching business model ideation in digital learning environments. By drawing on knowledge from pattern-based innovation, creativity, and conversational Artificial Intelligence, we built a personal ideation companion entitled PICO. Our companion navigates students through five common ideation phases, encouraging them to innovate business models in a divergent-convergent thinking style. The web-based tool covers diverse features on an educational, social, and motivational layer to teach business model basics and to promote creativity and versatile thinking along the ideation process. Based on our design science research project, we report on situational instantiation and provide abstract guidelines for its design and implementation in (entrepreneurship) education. The artifact has been evaluated in several formal and informal learning scenarios including altogether over 70 students from Information Systems and Entrepreneurship programs as well as 10 employees from company-driven training programs on innovation.},

While extant research has investigated the relationship using an ICT index, there has been no research looking at smartphones, the use of which has been closely associated with the explosive growth in the use of mobile apps and a build-out of large information systems to support their use. To address this gap, this research examines the relationship of ICTs and smartphones with CO2 emissions by employing a country-level data set for the period from 2009 to 2017. Our results show that the relationship of ICTs with CO2 emissions takes an inverted U-shaped curve form, consistent with the EKC hypothesis. Our results also show that CO2 emissions increase with initial increases in smartphone capital stock but decrease as smartphone stock increases further. These findings imply that carbon emissions go up with the penetration of ICTs in poorer countries but in wealthier countries, ICT penetration and smartphone stock are related to lower CO2 emissions. The results should not be taken as evidence that ICTs cannot lead to greater sustainability in poorer countries but should be seen as a call for the IS community to help all countries apply existing knowledge and develop new knowledge to use ICTs to reduce emissions in response to the immediate challenge of climate change.},

However, the question of whether these change agents can be equally effective in the beginning and at the end of their mandate has largely been ignored in the IS literature. To fill this gap, this paper examines how and why the role of change agent evolves as CIOs progress in their tenure in office. Drawing from the management and the IS literature and the results of a revelatory case study of the CIOs of a large university system in the U.S., this paper proposes a three-phase model describing what combination of change agentry models is followed by CIOs as they progress in their tenure and why. The combination of change agentry models that CIOs tend to follow during their time in office is explained by the patterns of evolution of five key characteristics: commitment to a paradigm, task knowledge, information diversity, task interest, and power and influence.},

This research presents a comprehensive systematic literature review, offering insights into the current state of FL advancements. Our study amalgamates various pivotal components influencing FL performance and elucidates their associations, fostering sustainable competitiveness. To evaluate the progress in this domain, we adopt the Theory-Context-Characteristics-Methodology (TCCM) framework, which systematically assesses the theories, contextual factors, characteristics, and methodologies employed in FL research. We identify distinct methods which have been combined with the FL algorithm by the organization and its host, or in collaboration to reach goals and support efficient decision-making. We complement the findings of our literature review by providing a synthesis of theories about FL for informed decision-making while taking into consideration the distinctive capabilities and affordances it offers.},

   abstract                      = {Survey is popularly used in conducting research. With the recent rise of big data, survey scholars are calling for integrating data mining methods into traditional survey studies to refine theories and exploit insights in new contexts. However, the integration of survey and data mining techniques to refine theories is still underdeveloped, and the importance of addressing the interpretability and non-interpretability of various data mining algorithms is greatly needed. To bridge these gaps, we integrate data mining predictions into a traditional survey-based study, demonstrating interpretable and uninterpretable algorithms that predict an individual's willingness to pay for e-learning markets. We provide a step-by-step guideline, from goal definition and data preparation to variable choice, prediction accuracy, and theory refinement, to assist survey scholars in combining the two research methods to enhance a well-regarded theory, the Technology Adoption Model (TAM). We discuss the trade-offs that survey scholars may encounter when combining the two methods in refining theories and suggest how they might overcome these inherent difficulties. By demonstrating a theory’s potential for improving prediction accuracy and exemplifying how data mining results can refine theories, our study contributes to survey scholars on how to refine theories to increase theoretical contributions with new data mining methods.},

Using a business game (BG) could be a suitable solution given its characteristics. Therefore, our goal is to design a BG to teach IS students the relationship between BMs and BPs. Toward this challenge, we follow a design science research approach to construct the BG. Based on the evaluation results of our first design cycle, we introduce a revised set of 14 design requirements and eight design principles guiding our design process. Besides, we demonstrate a revamped instantiation of the BG using a revised set of 24 design features. We also conduct two evaluation episodes comprising an experiment and confirmatory focus groups to assess the artifact's conceptualization and instantiation, proving its utility. Finally, we present a nascent design theory for BGs teaching the relationship between BMs and BPs. Our work contributes to the knowledge base on BG design in the domain of BMs and BPs.},

To address this gap, we conducted a case study in which reflective learning diaries were used in a course. The goal of this research is to investigate the potential of using reflective diaries to formatively evaluate three key features of SRL: conceptions of knowledge, conceptions of learning, and strategies for monitoring and regulating learning. Our findings suggest that reflective diaries are a valuable tool for formative evaluation of SRL in software engineering education. Reflection on learning experiences helps students develop self-awareness of their SRL skills and identify areas for improvement. Instructors can use this information to provide students with targeted feedback and support. By using reflective diaries to promote dialogic feedback, instructors can help students to develop a deeper understanding of their learning and become more effective self-regulated learners. The study concludes with lessons learned that provide practical recommendations for educators who are swiftly moving toward online teaching.},

Considering the significant emphasis on context-specific theorizing in the discipline, we reviewed the technique’s application, focusing on publications in the Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals. By conducting a critical review of 72 articles published over the past two decades, we identified variations in the technique’s application and underscored optimal approaches for scholars to consider.

This paper addresses a gap in the organizational information privacy literature by presenting a comprehensive and systematic literature review of the CPO role from 2000 to 2020. With the increasing recognition of CPOs' pivotal roles in enhancing information privacy practices across diverse sectors, this review aims to synthesize recent articles, identify research themes, pinpoint knowledge gaps, and propose avenues for future research. The study's contribution lies in providing a comprehensive literature review at the intersection of two main IS research streams: information privacy and IS leadership. We find limited research on information privacy that examines the CPO's role within relevant journals and conferences. The central theme that emerges from the literature is about identifying the CPO managerial roles, responsibilities, and background. We conclude by calling for more empirical research for a better understanding of the role and its impact.},

To improve user experience on the digital learning platform, START Foundation explored implementing a recommender system for personalized course navigation based on methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, this exploration raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding bias and fairness in AI systems. In light of these concerns, the following questions emerged: Should START Foundation integrate the AI-based recommender system into its digital learning platform? If so, what factors should START Foundation consider regarding bias and fairness in its AI-based recommender system in order to prevent negative consequences for its scholars?

While existing technology is primitive and barely adequate for the purpose, the continuous development of such technology indicates that it will mature and become increasingly effective for creating the conference experience.

In particular, we highlight potential issues with arguably common practices in some IS conferences, such as peer review invitations sent to researchers who have also submitted papers for publication consideration and the increasing number of reviews performed by graduate students. To address these issues, we suggest three solutions: 1) quid pro quo rules; 2) the use of incentive-compatible methods whose scores are linked to relevant rewards; and 3) the use of blockchain-based tokens in tandem with smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs. We conclude by offering directions the IS community can take to further study the highlighted issues and implement the proposed solutions.},

In this paper, we distill these ongoing discussions and apply them specifically to the issues identified in a recent AIS task force report on conference virtualization. We identify the stakeholders in the conference ecosystem and the risks they would incur from poor quality conference experiences. Through this analysis we provide 57 recommendations to mitigate the risks of a poor conference experience and to improve value-creation opportunities. We hope our recommendations and reflections can advance the debate and help conferences continuously adapt to their changing environment to realize their potential to generate value for their IS communities.},

It puts forward the environmental impact of extensive traveling and the strain and squandering on the volunteer-based academic system, exacerbated by the growing number of paper reviews to be handled every year and the growing tendency that attending conferences becomes a secondary matter for scholarly exchange and learning. Since there are no alternatives to scientific conferencing in the foreseeable future, the article's attention shifts towards the question of who has access to this scientific exchange. This discourse responds to the AIS taskforce's future plan for IS conferences, discussing some limitations of hybrid models in tackling inequality and diversity issues. The article concludes with the presentation of some obvious, and in some cases radical propositions, for changing the way scientific conferences encompassing a "hybrid" experience could be organized differently.},

In this paper, we reflect on that learning through a lens informed by reviewing published work on conference hybridization. We also make recommendations for how future conference chairs can think about AIS conferences. Changing how our conferences are delivered is risky, but simply returning to the old normal is also risky. As an association studying IT, discovering and championing the role of technology in conference experiences would seem to be a risk worth taking.},

The editors debate three questions: Are conferences still a viable means of academic exchange and community for the future? Given that both virtual and face-to-face options have opportunities and constraints, what can we do to have the best of both options? What consequences, intended and unintended, do new conference formats have for social inclusion and sustainability? We examine different types of hybrid formats and features and also consider the vexed question of how pricing may impact inclusion. We conclude with a call to consider that, for social inclusion, we have an obligation to make participation as rich as possible - some options should not offer a diminished experience. As outlined in this editorial and special issue, the challenges of making participation as rich as possible are manifold - but in doing so, we help both our community and the planet.},

In this paper, we report on a panel discussion held at the 28th Working Conference on Exploring Modeling Methods for Systems Analysis and Development (EMMSAD) with four esteemed experts representing four complementary and often conflicting perspectives on the role of modeling for sustainability – stakeholders, digitalization, degrowth and IT, and ethics. We report the key arguments of the panelists, discuss the roles of modeling in the analysis and design of sustainable systems, and, finally, elaborate on the conflicts among the perspectives, their effects, and potential resolutions.},

As previous research is scarce to explain the root causes of this lack of platform success, we conducted a Delphi study with global experts in the automotive industry to identify those factors that can explain why these incumbents are failing with their digital platform initiatives. We identified six categories that complement the established body of knowledge on failure factors with digital platforms. Based on that, we suggest an integrative framework to explain typical failures in digital platforms by incumbents.},

By identifying the goals, structures, perceived needs, and consequences of each workaround, we offer a better understanding of these workarounds along with a recommended approach to deal with these practices effectively—not only for healthcare but also for a broad array of work settings.},

Digital servitization literature has explored mechanisms for success in innovating IT-enabled services, indicating that the phenomenon is multifaceted and needs to be explained from multiple theoretical perspectives. We derive a conceptual model for success in innovating IT-enabled services covering its multifaceted nature by referring to knowledge-based and organizational control theory. We test this model using qualitative cases of IT-enabled service innovation initiatives in manufacturing firms and use set-theoretic analyses to account for the multifaceted nature of the phenomenon. The necessary condition analysis yields that a certain degree of service innovation capabilities is a prerequisite for success. With the results of a qualitative comparative analysis, we obtain five solution terms as causal recipes for success in innovating IT-enabled services. Our results contribute to research by offering a theory-based approach that explains the multiplicity of success in IT-enabled service innovation. Practitioners benefit from our results by understanding prerequisites and causal recipes for success while learning from unsuccessful initiatives in innovating IT-enabled services of manufacturing firms. Our study is also an example of how to rigorously calibrate qualitative data using a structured approach.},

Such use of data implies that organizational actors across different organizational functions are making decisions based on information derived from analytical insights. Yet, many companies find the journey to becoming a data-driven enterprise a bumpy ride. A key issue faced by most firms is that their data management approach is not ready for data and analytics-based decision-making. In this teaching case, we follow the journey of an industrial enterprise, PETRONAS, attempting to transform into a data-driven enterprise. We report on four key data-driven ‘blockers’ encountered by PETRONAS Downstream and provide insights into steps taken to address these data challenges. This case study is suitable for courses that explore digital transformation and data management in an organizational context, from strategic and operational perspectives. For example, instructors teaching a Digital Transformation course might use this case for a session dedicated to learning about data-readiness for digital transformation. It is intended for postgraduate students (Master and MBA levels) as well as late-stage undergraduate students. Specific angles that could be explored in depth are: identifying and capturing data-related requirements and issues from the perspectives of different organizational actors; examining interdependencies between functional and technical aspects of data management and use (e.g., requirements, availability, sustainability of data supply) for fast and reliable decision-making; sourcing of data: evaluating in-house and outsourced approaches for data sourcing and management; implementation of data-related projects and change management.},

In contrast to previous research that predominantly examines Social Media addiction, our emphasis lies on the utilitarian, rational, and goal-oriented aspects of Social Media usage. We analyze the impact of individual attitudes on SMD by integrating expectancy-value theory with media system dependency theory. Specifically, this paper investigates how one particular social axiom construct – Societal cynicism – influences SMD, taking into account the variations in the usage patterns between two widely used Social Media platforms: Facebook and YouTube. Through the development and validation of a research model, this research aims to shed new light on understanding the dependency phenomena within the context of Social Media.},

Thinking of IS usage as the hands-on use of computerized devices through interfaces is increasingly inadequate where roles and responsibilities are delegated to IT-enabled devices and systems that may operate autonomously and may not interact directly with users. This paper’s new IS usage theory (ISUT) consists of three axioms and 12 underlying assumptions that apply to IS usage for nontrivial sociotechnical and totally automated work systems. A background section includes the rationale for pursuing a new view of IS usage and basic concepts related to systems, information systems, work system theory (WST) and the ISUT’s boundary conditions. A summary of selected research articles related to IS usage emphasizes how central ideas in those articles diverge from the ISUT’s underlying assumptions and may not suffice for describing increasingly automated work practices. A two-dimensional agent responsibility framework facilitates the application of the ISUT’s system-oriented view of IS usage by combining a spectrum of IS roles and a series of facets of work. Four illustrative real-world examples demonstrate the practical application of the ISUT. The conclusion emphasizes this paper’s motivation, theory creation process, theory presentation and content, and contribution.},

However, qualitative methods that require manually perusing each document struggle with the width and breadth of such data. Although quantitative and qualitative big data share many challenges, we identified the practical challenges encountered by researchers, specifically with qualitative big data, and how these challenges were addressed. We reviewed 169 studies that used qualitative big data and identified three main categories of intertwined challenges: locating relevant data, addressing noise in the data, and preserving data richness. We found that the greater the amount of data and the richer they are, the greater the variety of types and sources of noise. While the volume of the data necessitates the use of algorithms, doing so entails the treatment of data in ways that decrease the richness of qualitative data. Furthermore, simultaneously ensuring high richness and veracity might be difficult because the algorithms are probabilistic, thus compelling researchers to balance the desired levels of volume, variety, and veracity. Although the identified solutions cannot completely solve this tripartite balancing, they can still be used to alleviate different aspects of such a challenge.},

We identified 46 theories from these disciplines, which we categorized into four main groups: psychological and behavioral, organizational, sociocultural, and decision-making. Additionally, we classified their constructs into eight key factors. Further, ten IDBs frequently studied in IS were identified. Our analysis identified relationships among these theories emphasizing shared concepts that improve our comprehension of IDB. These relationships and their implications for theory and practice are discussed offering insights into the multifaceted nature of insider deviance and the diverse theoretical lenses through which they can be examined.

At the event, five expert scholars introduced their perspectives on the study of data followed by breakout discussions. We synthesize three key themes from the workshop: 1) the semantic ambivalence of data in contemporary contexts, 2) new challenges in data sustainability, quality, and quantity, and 3) growing tensions in personal data collection and governance. We summarize how these and related developments change the game for data researchers and what new avenues for research open within each theme. Finally, we reflect on the implications for research and practice and offer suggestions on how to publish data research.},

Previous research on privacy has taken for granted the relationship involved in information sharing. Our research theorizes that the nature of the relationship itself plays a key role in influencing privacy concerns and trust. Using network theory, we posit that privacy concerns, trust, and information sharing occur at two levels: the relational as interpersonal (i.e., dyadic) and the individual as intrapersonal. Relationships characterized as multiplex, or multidimensional, are richer and experience greater trust while reducing privacy concerns. Utilizing data collected from work groups that use digital communication platforms, we analyze our data using a covariance-based SEM multilevel model approach. Our results indicate that greater multiplex relationships lead to increases in trust, which in turn leads to greater information sharing. Multiplexity does not impact privacy concerns. Surprisingly, privacy concerns have a positive relationship with information sharing, counter to previous research. Our findings suggest that privacy mechanisms are more complex than previously modeled because they depend on the quality and type of interpersonal relationship.},

However, existing studies in IS fall short of providing insights into how the IVR experience becomes meaningful for end-users. To increase granularity and specificity in this regard, researchers have suggested that the IVR experience can become meaningful due to its fleeting feeling of escapism. In this paper, I explore and characterize how individuals use the IVR experience to create meaning in the context of meaningful escapism, by undertaking a phenomenology inspired inquiry, based on Heideggerian views on meaning, meaningfulness, and world. Interviews and analysis were conducted within an empirical case of IVR fire safety training. As a result, four characteristics of the IVR experience as a meaningful form of escapism were unveiled: a sense of content, a sense of familiarity, a sense of mood, and a sense of care. Throughout this study, I offer a nuanced perspective on how the characteristics contribute to clarifying the distinctions and relationship between meaning and meaningfulness, as well as how the IVR experience becomes a meaningful escapism that provides an alternative of individual’s being-in-the-world, into a being-in-the-virtual-world, also known as Virtual Dasein. Further, this study contributes to the IS field by advancing the current discourse on IVR research and escapism, from a phenomenological perspective.},

Islamic boarding schools foster an educational culture that restricts students’ access to digital technologies. Graduates who have experienced this culture may represent a distinct group when compared to their peers from other formal educational institutions who have benefited more from exposure to digital technology upon entering university-level education. For university students, digital skills are essential in academic and social life. Due to their background, however, Islamic boarding school graduates’ digital journey may thus be far more difficult, and their digital literacy may be less accomplished than that of their peers upon entering university life. To investigate this phenomenon, this study will explore in-depth the digital experience of Islamic boarding school graduates as they commence their university education through a postphenomenological study of 8 participants in order to determine how they adapt to the digital aspects of university life. The results reveal the unique digital experience of each research participant both while studying at the boarding school and when commencing university education. The study also represents this digital experience under three different analytical themes: exposure, adaptation, and experience. There was a distinct difference between their lifeworld in their boarding school when contrasted with their university, which was influenced by technological exposure. It also highly affected their adaptation to technology when commencing their university. Technology is also shown to significantly shape and influence the students’ behaviors and assumptions about the digital.},

Despite organizations gaining a competitive edge through location analytics, its adoption within the academic Information Systems (IS) discipline remains sparse. The absence of spatial methodologies in analytical and behavioral IS research is striking. Furthermore, this lack of integration is evident as spatial problem-solving is scarcely covered in IS curricula, and location data analysis is often relegated as a peripheral skill. Our panel paper delineates the many opportunities location analytics presents for broadening research horizons and enriching IS education. We suggest incorporating location analytics into research by demonstrating how spatial methodologies can bolster IS research rigor. We also explain how integrating location analytics into the IS curricula can prepare students for this growing area of analytics. Foremost, we aim to catalyze a paradigm shift towards more spatially informed IS research and education.},

However, they still remain under-researched. Resultantly, we identify technologies complementing AI applications and investigate their configurational impact on healthcare services from a multi-stakeholder perspective. Through topic modeling analysis of 11,814 research articles, we unveil that healthcare digitalization (DIG), healthcare information management (HIM), and medical artificial intelligence (MAI) are the key complementary technologies bolstering AI implementations in the healthcare ecosystem. Furthermore, building on the foundations of configurational theory, we develop propositions delineating the interplay of technological synergies. We propose a conceptual framework comprising technological drivers for successful AI applications in healthcare. Our fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) offers important revelations: first, DIG is instrumental for AI-driven HIM, second, DIG and HIM are crucial for enhancing MAI. Third, but most importantly, we also establish that accommodating multi-stakeholder interests (MSI) is quintessential for the success of AI applications in healthcare. Our findings present a roadmap for healthcare administrators, emphasizing the role of synergies and stakeholder interests in enabling AI as a strategic initiative in healthcare service delivery.},

This systematic literature review seeks to comprehensively explore the implications of AI on employee privacy. The study addresses three key dimensions: (1) evaluating the extent to which AI technologies compromise or safeguard employee privacy; (2) elucidating the costs and benefits of AI adoption in organizations to strike a balance with employee privacy considerations; and (3) discussing the varying impact of advancing AI algorithms in the workplace on employee privacy. Drawing upon the privacy calculus framework, the paper underscores the trade-offs organizations make in managing employees' privacy in the context of AI integration. The discussion is grounded in an analysis of advancing AI algorithms and their dynamic influence on the delicate balance between organizational efficiency and the protection of employee privacy. By addressing the complexities inherent in this intersection, the research serves as a valuable resource for guiding further inquiry into the evolving relationship between advancing AI technologies and preserving employee privacy.},

This contributes to a wider trend of unqualified assumptions emerging within digital transformation research which has stunted theoretical and practitioner development within the initiative such as problematic axioms pertaining to the role of said third parties, the view of digital transformation as a process, or views on the role of value within a transformation. The assumptions and their associated impacts present major risk factors for successful digital transformation. Our study leverages assumption problematization and semi-structured interviews to explore the extent to which a digital transformation can be orchestrated by third parties outside of the organization with the associated findings providing alternative perspectives to expand the collective understanding of digital transformation within both research and practice.},

An emerging area in blockchain technology is smart contracts which hold much potential to transform the commercial real estate industry through the digitalization of decentralized business models that ensure transaction transparency and validity. Despite the potential benefits of smart contracts, their use in the commercial real estate industry is at a nascent stage. In response to this gap, this study proposes a novel approach using Ethereum blockchain technology to enable intermediaries to transact in an informationally symmetrical way within an open real estate in Switzerland. The proposed conceptual model employs tokenisation on the blockchain and is developed using the action design science research methodology. The model undergoes several stages of evolution from pre-design, which is validated through expert interviews, to arrive at the final conceptual design. The study identifies key factors that influence the application of blockchain in real estate transactions, namely adoption, governance and compliance, transaction costs, transparency and immutability, security, and scalability. The results indicate that smart contracts have the potential to significantly reduce transaction costs and improve efficiency in the commercial real estate industry.},

This paper focuses specifically on the information systems (IS) field and assesses ChatGPT’s knowledge. To analyze the extent and quality of information systems knowledge derived from queries to ChatGPT, we used over 3,000 queries from a broad range of exam and quiz questions. These queries were obtained from university courses and professional information system certification exams. The query topics are based on a framework for information systems education, with queries gathered from multiple faculty members at different universities. Our queries of ChatGPT with these questions finds that ChatGPT can answer 65% to 85% of information systems queries successfully, across each of the areas of the framework. ChatGPT performed well on essay, true/false and multiple-choice questions, with no statistical difference between its success rate on multiple-choice and true/false questions. We conclude that ChatGPT tends to perform approximately at the level of an average student but may not perform at a level sufficient to pass certain professional exams. ChatGPT’s knowledge is very broad, covering virtually all areas of the information system’s knowledge we identified, but not at an expert level.},

Our findings indicate a pressing need for more robust theoretical approaches that reconcile technical innovations with social and ethical considerations to enhance the usability, safety, security, sustainability, and ethicality of drone applications. IS scholars, equipped with a sociotechnical perspective and strong theoretical orientation, are uniquely positioned to address these deficiencies.

However, the inductive reasoning nature of DNNs presents challenges in generalizing how key structural factors—such as neurons, hidden layers, and epochs—affect learning capability and interact with one another. This study adopts a positivist approach, applying deductive reasoning and empirical analysis to explore the main and moderation effects of these structural factors on DNNs learning capability, as manifested in performance outcomes. Our empirical analysis shows that neurons, hidden layers, and epochs each positively influence learning capability. These effects are further shaped by dataset complexity, with intricate patterns amplifying their impact. However, hidden layers and epochs negatively moderate the impact of neurons. These findings clarify the often difficult-to-generalize results of inductive DNN studies and help address the lack of empirical evidence regarding the roles of DNN structural factors. Additionally, they reveal that simply increasing structural factors is not an effective strategy for improving DNN performance, demonstrating the challenges of optimizing these factors.},

Nonetheless, the considerable support for plant health research underscores the importance of addressing both human and environmental aspects in policy formulation. This study contributes to the growing DS dialogue by demonstrating how cognitive, emotional, and moral perceptions shape public backing for research on mobile radiation. These findings enhance our understanding of how public attitudes influence the adoption and regulation of green technologies in urban environments.

Her “ethico-onto-epistem-ology” is based on work done in quantum mechanics, science and technology studies, and feminist studies. It has motivated some scholars in different fields to significantly reconsider the ways they conceive the domains they study and the approaches they use to conduct their empirical work. In the information systems field, it has inspired work on sociomateriality. Because agential realism is a complex, nuanced philosophy, however, its strengths and weaknesses are still being teased out and contested. In this vein, I critique some major features of agential realism that I consider problematic. I examine and appraise Barad’s narratives about representationalism, reflexivity, agency, entanglement, phenomena, intra-actions, discursive practices, agential cuts, apparatuses, matter, posthumanism, objectivity and measurement, and space and time. In part, I consider whether these narratives are internally consistent. I also canvass whether the theory that underlies agential realism applies to macro-objects (such as social systems) and, if so, whether any practical implications arise.},

   abstract                      = {Boards of directors have an essential role in IT governance in organizations; however, many boards are falling short in this role. Many studies have attributed the lack of board IT governance to a competency gap. However, despite the importance of understanding this gap, there has been limited examination of what constitutes such competency. This paper unpacks the board IT competency construct by examining proxy and direct measures from the literature. Through a survey of 75 board directors in Sri Lanka, we found that while some proxy measures appear to be better measures of IT competency than other proxy measures, direct measures more accurately reflect board IT competency than proxy measures. To further assess the fitness of the proxy versus the direct measures we examined their relationship with board IT governance. We found that the direct measures are more strongly associated with board IT governance than the proxy measures. These findings expand the current understanding of how to measure board IT competency and provide support for its influence on board IT governance. Recommendations are given to researchers on how to measure board IT competency and to boards on how they can enhance their IT competency.},

We conducted an exploratory experiment involving a typical college course assignment to detect and compare genuine student responses with responses generated by ChatGPT. Using a text classification scheme that we devised, we showed that student responses are fairly accurately distinguishable from AI’s, not only when AI uses its general knowledge to answer questions, but also when it is prompted to use the same material used by students. In addition, we identified elements of authorship style, primarily related to formality, that can help humans set students’ and AI’s work apart. We also explored the strategies that students use and the depth at which they alter AI-generated content to make it “their own”. We found the alterations to be mostly moderate, and the modified text remained mostly detectable by our classification scheme. Overall, our results offer a transparent machine learning model for detecting AI-generated text, stylistic cues that can help humans detect such text, as well as insights into students’ strategies when borrowing content from AI agents.},

This participatory action research study is carried out in the four-year DigiBy project, based on the rural living labs approach, which operates in fifteen villages and three bookmobiles in rural Norrbotten County, northern Sweden. The project aims to adopt and adapt digital solutions to enhance rural retail services. Rural digital ecosystems like DigiBy aim to accelerate digital transformation so as to reduce the service gap and improve village living conditions. The key to such a transformation is an inclusive implementation of digital services, which seeks the active collaboration of various stakeholders, such as village associations, companies willing to adapt to rural situations, universities, municipalities, and residents. This article explores how low-tech digitalisation solutions in micro-organisations improve living conditions in rural societies by reducing the service gap between municipal centres and the surrounding villages. Our study is guided by social acceleration theory, providing a critical lens for understanding rural digital transformation.},

We posit that with increasingly complex and ill-defined problems that face IS graduates, acquiring problem scoping skills is essential to help students work with emerging problems in today’s workplace. We ask the following question: in what ways can students learn problem scoping skills in service-learning IS courses? This paper presents findings from a research-driven pedagogy study consisting of pre- and post- scenarios that students considered at the beginning and end of the semester in a service-learning undergraduate IS course. Through a qualitative analysis of students’ responses about the first two steps that they would take in working on the hypothetical projects, we identified thirteen categories and three themes. The emerging themes provide evidence of students' increased focus on problem scoping and context, on the relationship with the client, and on moving away from immediately delving into technical problem solving. Our findings provide significant contributions to the IS literature on service-learning as well as transferable course design principles.},

CBDCs combine new technology-enabled infrastructure and service innovation from the realm of FinTech and Decentralized Finance with the well-established and highly regulated area of central banking. While current practice and research primarily focus on designing specific CBDC systems or the governmental role, the role of companies and the private sector in the CBDC ecosystem still needs to be explored. Addressing this gap is particularly pertinent given the uncertainty surrounding which value propositions from traditional financial ecosystems and those from Fintech and blockchain-based financial ecosystems might be transferable to the realm of CBDCs. In this regard, the potential emergence of entirely novel value propositions companies could offer uniquely to CBDCs adds another layer of complexity. This paper aims to fill this gap by shedding light on private organizations’ value propositions in CBDC ecosystems. Through a multivocal literature review, we comprehensively gather both academic and practitioner insights. We aggregate value propositions directly stated in the current literature base and verify and complement these findings by mapping the needs of a CBDC ecosystem to value propositions companies might offer to fulfill these needs.},

Based on an in-depth, qualitative case study and interviews with the leadership team of Smukfest, one of the largest festivals in Denmark, we show that (1) business leaders face several digital transformation challenges, including fear of surveillance, balancing intuition and objectivity, and knowing how to leverage data-driven decision-making; and that (2) they can manage these challenges through mitigating actions which include developing digital competencies, storytelling to communicate digital transformation potential, and motivating data use. We synthesize these findings and theorize the Executive Action Strategies of Engagement (EASE) framework, which provides a new perspective on digital transformation management grounded in empirical observations. The framework guides practitioners by clarifying the roles of business leaders in digital transformation toward data-driven decision-making.},

To tackle this, the paper introduces an innovative automated framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs), like Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, to update A&S statements. First, using a series of quantitative analyses based on state-of-the-art natural language processing methods, we show the ability of LLMs to rate the fitness of research articles to the journals’ A&S. Following that, evaluating more than 4000 abstracts from 13 top-tier IS journals, the study reveals potentially outdated A&S statements. Using the GPT-3.5 API, the framework assesses recent papers for alignment with the journal’s scope, identifying emerging areas and interdisciplinary aspects, and suggests a new improved version of A&S encompassing those areas. This enables periodic A&S updates to mirror dynamic IS trends. Also, by investigating the proposed A&S updates, we discuss the evolution of the IS discipline over the past several years.},

   abstract                      = {Business Process Management (BPM) plays a critical role by driving digital innovation and enhancing organizational agility. Due to its importance in information systems (IS), educational institutions worldwide offer diverse BPM courses. However, a notable gap remains in teaching resources that offer real-world cases with a strong focus on diverse organizational contexts. This teaching case fills this gap by presenting the employees’ performance management process of a small-to-medium enterprise (SME) in a developing nation. The case offers a unique perspective in BPM by illuminating its interplay with contextual complexities in the SME environment. The case highlights an underexplored area on BPM - the critical role of effectively integrating and managing employees’ performance within operational workflows - by bridging theory with practice and fostering digital-oriented problem-solving skills. The case is designed with student tasks centered around a structured process lifecycle approach, utilizing real-life process data and supported by comprehensive teaching materials. It is practical, engaging, user-friendly, and adaptable across diverse learning environments, making it a valuable resource in BPM education. This case enables educators to effectively teach complex BPM topics while fostering practical skills in students.},

Socio-economic and geo-political implications, in addition to contemporary settings of information technology use, challenge the achievement of non-profit aims. Among others, interest in further investigation concerns DT-enabled change management and implementation regarding non-profit organizations (NPOs). Previous research started exploring the impact of DT processes on NPOs’ work. However, the characteristics of their DT processes remain unclear because of the diversity of social mission scopes. This paper contributes by examining the state of the art of the DT debate focused on NPOs. We propose a mixed-methods meta-synthesis for classifying and clustering the pertinent literature. We adopt a qualitative approach to identify a set of mutually exclusive dimensions summarizing the discourse and providing a taxonomy of the analyzed articles. Then, based on a quantitative approach, we investigate the relationships emerging from such classification and recognize clusters of articles sharing common characteristics. Beyond the results of the literature analysis, the main contribution of this work is a research agenda identifying issues and future directions. This study outlines three overarching directions in which NPOs foster specific DT initiatives: how, who, and what (to change) operating within a digitalized society.},

Specifically, it investigates the impact of intrinsic motivation, perceived usefulness, confirmation of expectations, and satisfaction on users’ continuous engagement with virtual shopping stores. A mixed method approach was used: the first exploratory study (qualitative) involved 18 participants, and the second confirmatory study (quantitative) involved 427 respondents. Results showed that perceived usefulness had a non-significant association with usage continuance intention for products from AR-based online fashion stores. By highlighting factors that impact users’ long-term involvement with AR in online fashion retail, this study can significantly shape the future of e-commerce. It can potentially inform the decisions of designers and marketers, who in turn can improve user experiences and encourage continued engagement with AR-based fashion stores.},

In the information systems (IS) domain, access to real-life information technology (IT) is required. Nevertheless, it often needs more than access, such as contract processing, suitable curricula, or lecturer training. In many cases, these activities are managed bilaterally between an educational institution and a company. The resulting partnerships, however, bear the risk of dispersing as soon as strategic, technological, or staffing conditions change. To address this issue, we examine the ecosystemic approach toward academic-industry partnerships. The ecosystemic approach applies the concept of competence centers as independent intermediary hubs. Using the SAP University Alliances (SAP UA) program as an example of the ecosystemic approach, we iteratively develop an e3 value model of the ecosystem by interviewing its stakeholders and validating the resulting model at a conference with the SAP UA community. Further, we develop six role concepts and respective requirement dimensions that facilitate effective knowledge exchange in IT companies’ academic ecosystems. Our contributions provide insights into how such an ecosystem can be structured and critically assess application fields by considering the continuous changes affecting the IS education community. Implications for practitioners and researchers in the field of academic-industry collaboration are discussed.},

Our research – a tailored DSR approach – was conducted over a 10+ year period within the multi-disciplinary research programme U-CARE. As information systems researchers, we worked as researchers and developers, in tight collaboration with psychologists, economists, medical doctors, nurses, and other key stakeholders. Through this process, we continually reflected and abstracted our experiences into design principles and DSR methodology. In response to the first research question, we introduce a set of design principles for web-based psychosocial support, shaped by the overarching LAME DSR approach. These principles include malleability for adaptability and sustainability, privacy and accountability in online environments, and a focus on stakeholder-specific functionalities like therapist dashboards and smooth authentication processes. In response to the second research question, we present the LAME DSR approach and an informed argument concerning its role in the establishment of a strategic, high-impact research environment.},

The technology solution monitored the location 24hrs a day 7 days a week and had the capability of identifying tigers, leopards, and other predators, and sending out automated, real time alerts to help prevent human-animal conflict situations. Based on the outcome of the pilot, the solution could be refined and then a wider rollout could be planned.},

In this context, a relational perspective grounded in sociomateriality has gained prominence. This perspective views agency as emerging from the interactions among humans and technological systems. Despite its existence within the IS community, the relational paradigm remains underrepresented in discussions of AI agency due to its ontological complexities. Recognizing that it offers potential solutions to conceptual challenges faced by alternative perspectives, the article aims to enhance the accessibility and applicability of the relational perspective for AI research. We provide a structured overview and comparative analysis of agency concepts in IS research, derived from a systematic literature review of 295 journal articles from IS and adjacent disciplines. Besides relational agency, the review identifies two other main conceptualizations of agency: inherent agency and behavioral agency. To explain their differences, we contrast the relational perspective with the alternative frameworks, detailing their respective strength and limitations. Finally, we communicate open questions and research directions to promote the practical application of a relational perspective in studying AI technologies.},

Theoretical foundations drawn from the stereotype content model, the psychological distance literature, and the situational crisis communication theory have informed the predictions. Among the Chinese, emoji in social media responses reduced psychological distance and alleviated anger, which had positive impacts on evaluations of the company involved in the incident. The impact was particularly evident when the business social media account (vs. the CEO account) employed emoji. Furthermore, emoji in incident responses signaled warmth and competence, while its impact was contingent on incident type. The positive emoji effect on competence was stronger when the company was deemed responsible for the incident indicating Chinese’ public appreciation for emoji as an additional communication effort for emotional disclosure and relationship maintenance. In contrast, people from the United States negatively evaluated the use of emoji in such responses, especially when the CEO facing an internally caused incident utilized it. This study is the first study to delineate differential understandings of emoji use and its competing effects on warmth and competence as cognitive underpinnings of contradictory emoji effects across different cultures. Our findings offer important theoretical and practical implications in digitally-mediated communication related to IS incidents.},

Moreover, cognitive functioning is usually measured in an in-laboratory setting, although digital measuring at-home would be beneficial. Thus, digitally measuring cognitive functioning over an extended period of time can provide valuable insights into sleep health. Based on findings from a two-year action design research project, dimensions of the design and development of a digital platform to deliver at-home measuring of cognitive functioning were explored. The digital platform was designed with the primary objective of achieving high usability while preserving the validity of relevant clinical measurements. The main contribution of this paper consists of conceptualizing and theorizing care pathways through digital platforms based on our novel findings from co-designing and evaluating the platform with professionals and 55 participants, leading to the formulation of VALID framework to inform the ongoing design and development process of digital platforms of the future.},

To that end, we examine the use of GAI in undergraduate business analytics optimization and programming courses. The courses required students to formulate and solve the problems on their own and also to explicitly use a GAI tool and critique its performance and effect on their learning process. We find that students' reactions were mixed, some noting their lack of prompt generation skills or not trusting the results, but overall the experience was positive with students highlighting efficiency and optimism for the future of GAI tools. We suggest a call to embrace GAI tools by helping students understand their uses and limitations to ensure students are “job ready” and also to adapt our teaching to better highlight problem solving and critical thinking skills.},

To address this, we conducted a critical review of the literature on digital gaming experiences within the IS domain. Our review involved defining the concept of gaming experience and establishing boundary conditions to guide the review. A hermeneutic approach was applied to include 277 articles from 51 journals in the review. Our synthesis of the literature identified three aggregate research themes (internal dynamics of game players, game systems, and contextual experience) from existing gaming experience literature. Our critical analysis reveals the need for more focus on a process-based understanding of gaming experiences to better capture the dynamic and processual nature of digital gaming, as existing studies mostly draw on a variance-based perspective. We present a framework that illustrates a process-based understanding of the gaming experience. This framework informs a research agenda that suggests adopting a process perspective in future studies could better address challenges in gaming experience research, particularly those involving game updates, monetization changes, and playing across different situational contexts.},

Our findings indicate that although RAT is widely prevalent in the literature, it often neglects critical aspects such as detailed victim profiles and underlying factors influencing susceptibility to phishing attacks. To address this gap, we developed a new cybercriminological theory that specifically aims to explain phishing victimization. The proposed Experience-Consequence Theory of Phishing Susceptibility focuses on the understanding of the consequences of clicking on suspicious links and the victims’ prior experiences with phishing. These elements can help security professionals identify better strategies for reducing phishing victimization by tailoring security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs to meet the specific needs of their employees. Furthermore, this theory has managerial implications because it offers organizations a more comprehensive and robust approach to reducing the risk of social engineering and improving the overall security posture.},

Through a survey involving 331 participants from Amazon MTurk, we explore the varied effects of personality traits on AR immersive experiences. To ensure the robustness of the results, we utilized both variance-based SEM and co-variance-based SEM. Results show that agreeableness and openness positively affect the AR immersive experience, while conscientiousness partially influences the AR immersive experience.

The findings reveal that all five datasets have a substantial number of items that are no longer accessible via their original URLs. Further, a longitudinal analysis over two and a half years reveals a statistically significant increase in this unavailability. The study identifies and categorizes the factors driving this unavailability, including account termination, content being made private by users, and items removed by platforms due to policy violations.

Using econometric models, we estimate the relationships between these FGOC signals and abnormal stock returns. Our findings reveal that disseminating a greater number of strong image-enhancing FGOC signals, particularly those related to new products and financial matters, significantly enhances stock performance, resulting in higher abnormal stock returns.

This study contributes to the literature by illuminating the interplay between different types of FGOC, addressing the need for research on how varying informational elements interact in social media contexts.

I contribute to the literature on responsible AI by exploring the institutional pressures that drive or inhibit its implementation, synthesizing the challenges to its implementation, and providing an overview of the roles and strategies AI practitioners use to deal with the implementation of responsible AI.

   abstract                      = {As the use of artificial intelligence surges across various sectors, institutions of higher education are witnessing a growing interest in related courses. Students from diverse professional and personal backgrounds are increasingly drawn to artificial intelligence in general and to machine learning in particular. The teaching of artificial intelligence and machine learning is gradually expanding beyond disciplines such as computer science and engineering where such material has traditionally been taught. Educators now face the challenge of creating and delivering content that is not only practical but also relevant and engaging to all participants in the educational process. Our study introduces an innovative approach to teaching computer vision at a business school through customizing a real-time object detection application that is accessible to non-computer science majors such as students specializing in entrepreneurship or information systems among other fields. This hands-on method involves students in every phase, from collecting images to building, deploying, and testing models in real time, ensuring active engagement and ownership of their learning by focusing on application customization rather than coding. We present our proposed approach, discuss insights gained from using it in the classroom, and explore its potential adaptation by educators considering it for their own teaching.},

Designers must build upon the available body of knowledge, reuse it within another setting, and reflect on the lessons learned during the use to advance the state of the art. As recent research points to limited reuse of both design knowledge and design artifacts, we believe that the process of codifying, enhancing, and building on previous research can be enriched by nuanced viewpoints and supportive practices. Against this backdrop, we transfer well-established theories for creating value through reuse from the field of circularity into a coherent framework for ‘circular design principles’. Our framework complements the existing guidance on reuse by (1) introducing lifecycle thinking of design knowledge, (2) theorizing about the process of reusing in DSR, as well as (3) diversifying the concept of reuse. In line with the accumulation tradition of research, we seek to aid scholars in operationalizing and complementing existing knowledge as well as positioning their papers as a form of reuse research.},

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of extant literature, combining bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review to explore the current state, primary themes, and future prospects of the PPA literature. Our research indicates that PPA research is in its early stages of development. While existing literature has predominantly examined privacy, personalization, trust, advertising, social media, and e-commerce, there has been a growing emphasis on targeted advertising and artificial intelligence in more recent studies. PPA is grounded in theoretical frameworks from privacy like Privacy Calculus Theory and from marketing such as the Persuasion Knowledge Model. Given that customer privacy concerns and trust in a firm can influence ad outcomes negatively, it is essential for researchers to explore scenarios where personalization might prove ineffective. In addition, examining firm strategies regarding personalized ads to mitigate negative ad outcomes is crucial.},

This teaching case is designed to immerse students in the role of a product manager to address a real-world challenge in collaboration with a Gen AI agent. Specifically, students will be required to formulate customer problems, ideate solutions, and design online experiments to test their identified problem-solution set. By having this practical experience of jointly executing varied tasks, students will gain insights into the rising importance of critical thinking skills and prompt engineering skills for harnessing the unprecedented potential of Gen AI in the workplace. Further, this experience will help students to understand the evolving roles and task responsibilities of knowledge workers in the era of Gen AI. Alternatively, this case can also be used to teach the concept of problem reframing exclusively. This case is suitable for teaching undergraduate and graduate students pursuing studies in information systems.

The study further extends TCV by analyzing the moderating role of openness-to-change values (OTC) and gender on visibility-intention relationships. Data is gathered from consumers who are exposed to the idea of digital healthcare technology and is analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results illustrate that the visibility of digital healthcare technologies and consumption values positively influence adoption intentions. The consumption values (except social and epistemic value) mediate the visibility-intention relationship. Furthermore, OTC as a moderator is observed to be dampening the positive visibility-intention relationship, and gender as a moderator shows that that females are calculative and males are spontaneous. Theoretical implications of the study highlight the extension of TCV by uncovering the mediating-role of multidimensional consumption values and the moderating effects of openness-to-change (OTC) and gender in shaping adoption intentions toward digital healthcare technologies. Hence, visibility emerges as an extended arm to the theory, and exploring the moderating and mediating factors signifies to be useful for policymakers and practitioners in fostering better decision making.},

Prior studies have discussed how to build CFs, yet these are mainly focused on their specific research domain and conflate the construction of a CF with research design. Therefore, it can be difficult to view CFs as part of an independent phenomenon—the process of creating a CF to accomplish a definite purpose in research. This problem is particularly relevant in information systems, where CFs are important research contributions. This study adopts a design perspective on the construction of CFs and positions CF design as an independent phenomenon. Peircean Semiotics is used as a foundation for CF design, which allows strict separation between the CF and all aspects of research. Based on Peircean Semiotics, a scheme for CF design is proposed. The scheme is illustrated in a case. This study contributes to a better understanding of the construction of CFs.},

(1989), which is frequently cited in papers and textbooks. Moreover, although the DIKW pyramid outlines the path from data to wisdom, the emergence of technologies like big data and artificial intelligence (AI) has intensified research on misinformation, disinformation, and ignorance, which are overlooked in the DIKW pyramid. Furthermore, studies on sub-components of the hierarchy are in siloed pieces of literature. In this study, we conduct a multidisciplinary theoretical review, present a theory elaboration, and introduce a conditional probability framework for the information hierarchy. We employ a construct specification approach and a meta-synthesis to present a refined framework that more precisely represents the information hierarchy than the traditional DIKW pyramid and incorporates the implications of big data and AI. This novel theory elaboration study improves construct validity, scope, and understanding of the information hierarchy and its relevance in contemporary contexts.},

This paper critically examines dominant narratives around AI and its impact on jobs, challenging technology-deterministic predictions of widespread job loss. We introduce two key concepts: the 'reinstatement effect,' which suggests AI can create new jobs by generating demand for new activities, and 'human-technology augmentation,' which emphasizes AI’s potential to enhance human capabilities. Together, these perspectives provide a comprehensive view of AI’s influence on jobs. At the core of our argument is the focus on social good and the importance of regulation in shaping AI’s future impact on jobs.},

Nevertheless, our understanding of how organizational members perceive digital assistants still needs further investigation. Using figurative language analysis involving in-depth interviews, we explore the idiomatic expressions that organizational participants drew on in their accounts of digital assistants. Our analysis reveals the value of idioms for understanding themes regarding how digital assistants are perceived in a workplace context. These themes depict both the opportunities and challenges, with the former encompassing the ability to focus on value-added activities, productivity, and efficiency gains, as well as reducing job monotony, and the latter including themes such as uncontrollability and unexpectedness, tracking and privacy, transparency, and trust. The study illustrates the usefulness of idiomatic expressions as a fresh lens to understand how people express their thoughts, views, and feelings, as well as uncover issues associated with digital assistants that are not well understood.},

While interest in Metaverse tourism is on the increase, there is a distinct lack of research into understanding those motivating factors that drive people to jump into these virtual tourism platforms. This research fills that knowledge gap by exploring the drivers of the main users' intention to adopt the Metaverse tourism platform. Guided by Commitment-Trust Theory and Social Presence Theory, this study has looked into the potential of virtual experiences within the Metaverse to emulate traditional experiences in tourism and may even surpass them. This quantitative study surveyed 389 subjects in India through purposive sampling and analyzed using PLS-SEM. The findings revealed that perceived value and satisfaction increased when social interactions featured positive responses with a high sense of presence. These enhancements, in turn, build commitment and trust that may, in general, influence intention to adopt these platforms. The findings of this study contribute to the ever-evolving knowledge of Metaverse tourism, with valuable insights for industry leaders in crafting immersive and trust-oriented virtual experiences. Some of the policy recommendations in the study aim to foster technology adoption in tourism.},

Our research extends the resource orchestration framework for frugal Fintech ecosystem development by introducing five unique sub-processes: bricolaging, prioritizing, emulating, extrapolating, and sandboxing. These sub-processes provide a comprehensive understanding of how resources can be managed and utilized effectively. For practitioners, our study offers an empirically based guide to the initial establishment of a Fintech ecosystem. Policymakers can use our framework to design and implement regulatory models tailored to their specific environmental uncertainties, fostering growth and sustainability in Fintech ecosystems.},

The technological/organizational perspective in digital services studies cannot capture how asymmetrical power relations and digital social exclusion affect digital public services. Therefore, we propose a relational perspective based on Bourdieu's theory of practice, applying his main concepts to analyze these relations: social field, habitus, and capital. The analytical framework is applied to two digital public service implementation cases targeting populations in digital social exclusion: unemployment insurance for artisanal fishers and the general fishing register, implemented in artisanal fishing communities in the Brazilian Amazon region. The cases illustrate the asymmetry of power in digital public services, as reflected in the social practices of state agents who designed the systems without involving citizens. The artisanal fishers struggled to access the digital services as planned, requiring mediation by representative entities. The proposed framework effectively analyzed the cases and can be applied in other studies focusing on asymmetrical power relations in contexts of digital social exclusion related to digital public services.},

The study begins with practitioner discussions to understand real-world project experiences, revealing a potential discrepancy between what is taught in academic settings and what is practiced in industry. Next, a survey of 485 database professionals is conducted and supplemented by follow-up interviews with 34 professionals. Findings indicate that fewer than 40% of practitioners consistently use formal conceptual data modeling, even in cases when they would like to do so. The survey identifies reasons for not using conceptual data modeling, and the follow-up interviews provide the practitioners with clarifications of the identified barriers. This research finds a positive association between conceptual modeling use and overall satisfaction with the outcome of the database development process. Lastly, the findings of this research offer important implications for both database practitioners and educators.},

This paper uses a mixed-method approach to examine this issue. Based on a review of prior literature, a framework is proposed, highlighting the role of individuals’ motivations, habits, self-control, and the socio-environmental forces that influence the maintenance of hedonic IT abstinence. The framework is fine-tuned based on a qualitative study of individuals who took up to a week-long break from social networking sites (SNS) as a prominent case of hedonic IT. The refined model captures the roles of self-efficacy to abstain, IT habit, IT abstinence habit, and peer pressure on hedonic IT abstinence maintenance, which in turn explains positive changes in productivity and intention to moderate future use. The refined research model is tested via a quantitative study among a separate group of SNS users.},

The purpose of this study is thus to reexamine prior perceptions of paradigmatic progress by articulating the epistemological stances of nations and institutions in the IS field. Upon reviewing papers published in eight premier journals from 2005 to 2020, I categorized the epistemological orientations by nations and institutions and identified a visible divide that separated epistemological mentality of North America, Continental Europe, and Asia from that of the British Isles, Oceania, and Scandinavia. While positivist research continued to dominate the field, it was most prevalent not in North America, as traditionally perceived, but in Asia. Drawing on a dialectic pluralist perspective, I contend that there is a critical need to increase the field’s academic diversity. Research implications, especially on how to bridge the emerging continental divide and enrich the field’s research diversity, are discussed.},

We synthesize the skills and dispositions needed by DA professionals into six key characteristics: technical skills, Business domain skills, communication and collaboration skills, innovativeness, grit, and critical thinking, along with supporting descriptions and details. We find corroboration for our study results from DA job postings and explore the alignment of the results with studies of information systems (IS) professionals.

Specifically, we investigate the relationship between two theorized antecedents of OSD—self-presentation and work-home conflict—and the dimensions of OSD. Additionally, we posit that organizational culture factors may affect these relationships. Specifically, we investigate the impacts of segmentation culture and work location flexibility on the relationships between self-presentation and the OSD dimensions. We collected data from 309 active social networking service users. We found that 1) self-presentation positively impacts each of the OSD dimensions, 2) work-home conflict positively impacts OSD amount, and 3) both segmentation culture and work location flexibility moderate the relationship between self-presentation and OSD amount. Implications for theory and practice and future research directions are discussed.},

We derive design requirements for image-mining-based decision support systems from literature and expert interviews. Drawing on research in image mining and decision support systems, we conceptualize design principles to address the design requirements. Subsequently, we instantiate and evaluate them in the machining industry with the help of an artifact to support tool wear analysis. The results prove the validity of our design knowledge.

The results indicate that established ethical principles continue to be relevant for GenAI systems but their salience and interpretation may shift, and that there is a need to recognize new principles in these systems. We identify six GenAI ethics principles: 1) respect for intellectual property, 2) truthfulness, 3) robustness, 4) recognition of malicious uses, 5) sociocultural responsibility, and 6) human-centric design. Addressing the challenge of satisfying multiple principles simultaneously, we suggest three meta-principles: categorizing and ranking principles to distinguish fundamental from supporting ones, mapping contradictions between principle pairs to understand their nature, and implementing continuous monitoring of fundamental principles due to the evolving nature of GenAI systems and their applications. To conclude, we suggest increased research emphasis on complementary ethics approaches to principlism, ethical tensions between different ethical viewpoints, end-user perspectives on the explainability and understanding of GenAI, and the salience of ethics principles to various GenAI stakeholders.},

   abstract                      = {As technologies pervade workplaces, job designers look for an integrative framework that considers IT's enabling and constraining impact on worker well-being across diverse job contexts. Using context theorizing guidelines, this paper proposes an integrated Framework of IT Job Infusion that can be used to examine worker outcomes for various IT-infused jobs. The framework holds that (1) IT possesses properties that manifest as resources or demands, and (2) these resourceful and demanding manifestations of IT affect a worker’s perceptions of the task, physical, social, and organizational job contexts and job outcomes. The framework is then applied to the truck driving context experiencing IT infusion. The results of data gathered from 154 truck drivers validate our proposed framework. We conclude with the theoretical and practical implications of the framework.},

Despite its significance, the challenges inherent in policymaking, stemming from the multifaceted nature of IT, remain poorly understood. This paper explores how an IT artefact evolves as a policy object throughout a 4.5-year public policy cycle centered on the Finnish Taximeter Law. We make two contributions. As a theoretical contribution, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding the IT artefact as a policy object. This framework identifies three forms of the artefact: a mental construct, a policy text, and a material IT artefact. Additionally, we propose a distinction between IT artefacts at the policy level and IT artefacts as real-world technologies. Second, we shed light on the challenges of translating multifaceted, real-world IT artefacts into abstract policy texts and subsequently reinterpreting these texts back into actionable, real-world technologies. Specifically, we enhance the understanding of the dynamics involved in public policymaking concerning IT artefacts. We reflect on the practical implications of our research by drawing on the case of “artificial intelligence as policy object” in the context of the European AI Act. Our findings thus hold implications for both IS researchers and policymakers.},

It engages the users and helps them to serve their purposes. Few studies exist discussing metaverse as an immersive technology though there is a dearth of studies that empirically examine the factors associated with the corresponding user experience. We analysed over 400 thousand user reviews on 14 metaverse applications from Google Play Store to identify those factors associated with the corresponding user experience. We uncovered the pertinent factors with the help of a topic modelling technique and explained their associations with the help of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and Cognitive Absorption Theory (CAT) crafting a unified framework. Multiple regression models help us to validate the proposed framework. We find that sociability, density, telepresence, temporal dissociation, focused immersion, heightened enjoyment, curiosity, and playfulness positively influence the user experience of the virtual immersive space of the Metaverse. These insights can help policymakers and academicians take apt measures to make the Metaverse space more immersive and engrossing.},

Although interactive learning videos can be helpful in supporting students' learning process, the design of such videos is still challenging for instructional designers. To overcome these challenges, we follow a Design Science Research (DSR) approach and develop a design pattern-based process to support the development of interactive learning videos. To this end, we engage in multiple DSR cycles where we conduct a systematic literature review, collect practical and theoretical requirements, as well as develop and evaluate our artifact in two cycles. Finally, we codify our results into design patterns and a creation process for interactive learning videos. With our contribution, we make design knowledge for such learning materials accessible by including tangible and applicable practices during our interactive learning video creation process. Our contribution aims to support developers and educators in designing more effective learning videos.},

The study finds that rewards and digital experience have significant influence on IT identity while digital embeddedness and digital self-efficacy are insignificant to the formation of IT identity. Furthermore, the study discovers that IT identity significantly influences both digitally enabled in-role and innovative job performance. This study enhances the understanding of the formation of IT identity and its impact on digital performance in digital work in the evolving landscape of the “new normal” working environment and offers a validated framework for further investigation into digital work practices.},

Through a mixed-method approach, combining scientometric techniques, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, Necessary Condition Analysis, and Importance-Performance Mapping Analysis, we aim to understand the fit between banking CAs and consumer needs, by classifying, investigating, and isolating the necessary and important influencing elements contributing to the fit. The findings suggest that although three distinct factors relating to the individual (user), organization (banks), and system (CAs) play a role in the aforesaid integration, only organizational and systemic factors are crucial.

Our study draws upon and extends several streams of work, particularly the importance of owners’ location and the role of crisis in online prosocial behavior, namely online donations. Further, we project and empirically test an important theoretical tension. On the one hand, the altruism effect predicts that beneficiaries colocated with a crisis will likely attract more donations. On the other hand, the bystander effect indicates that donors may perceive lower importance of their contribution as the responsibility of aiding the affected gets distributed. Thus, the effect of crisis colocation on the beneficiary’s project is equivocal, requiring empirical assessment. We address this tension empirically using the occurrence of a hurricane as the external crisis coupled with coarsened exact matching. Drawing on a donation platform dataset that facilitates schools in the US to seek funds, we find empirical support for the bystander effect. Additionally, we find that the baseline effect is contingent on the racial makeup of the beneficiary’s location and the extent to which a crisis occurs abruptly. Our study has implications for the theory and practice of managing online prosocial behavior.},

We integrated student resistance with enablers of technology adoption to analyze their cumulative impact on students' intentions to adopt e-learning systems. We developed two research models: one using Process Virtualization Theory (PVT) and the second integrating PVT with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2). We validated these models by administering a standardized instrument to students (n=516) enrolled in various courses across different universities in the National Capital Region of India. Our findings show that process characteristics such as perceived sensory, relationship, and synchronization requirements significantly determine student resistance to e-learning systems. Students' resistance was negatively associated with their intentions to adopt e-learning systems and user resistance significantly mediated the relationship between the enablers of technology adoption and intention to use. This research presents a model to enhance e-learning in universities, promoting quality education and advancing sustainable development goals (SDG) 4.},

   abstract                      = {Privacy concerns related to surveillance technologies are a primary deterrent for consumers hesitant to share their health data with service providers in smart health monitoring systems (SHMSs). These concerns can impede the adoption and operational success of SHMSs, leading to dissatisfaction among both consumers and service providers. Despite the significance of privacy, existing literature on SHMSs tends to offer a somewhat fragmented exploration of this concept due to the complex nature of surveillance and the involvement of multiple stakeholders. To address this gap, this study develops a contextual framework based on a systematic review of 49 peer-reviewed articles, offering valuable insights for scholars seeking to understand the multifaceted privacy concerns in SHMS contexts. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating theoretical perspectives that better capture the intricate dynamics of smart health environments, helping healthcare providers and policymakers identify and address potential privacy issues when developing and implementing surveillance systems for personal health information. Additionally, the study highlights existing knowledge gaps and proposes six research avenues to achieve a deeper understanding of privacy in SHMSs.},

This study offers an analysis of the defining characteristics of Fortune 500 CIOs and compares them to their executive peers. Using an inductive methodology, we examine the career trajectories of 2,821 Fortune 500 executives, including 400 CIOS, through LinkedIn data and leverage interviews with six Fortune 500 CIOs to contextualize the findings. The results highlight several distinct patterns: aspiring CIOs tend to be more racially diverse, work across a greater number of companies, hold more positions over their careers, and take longer to reach executive roles compared to other C-suite members. Through predictive modeling, we identify that CIOs can reduce the time it takes to reach top CIO positions by seeking out internal promotion opportunities at those same companies. This paper concludes with actionable recommendations for aspiring CIOs and outlines how these insights inform both practice and future research on IT leadership.},

Given the tremendous failure costs, the challenges and causes of megaprojects' performance issues draw attention from project management practitioners and the research community. Information systems research explores technology’s role in shaping and transforming business and society. However, technology’s role in addressing megaproject performance is still under-researched, as evidenced by a search in the leading information systems (IS) journals. Among the emerging technologies, blockchain’s applicability in addressing challenges in megaproject performance is relevant for critical infrastructure development projects. The blockchain can potentially deliver cures to address megaproject challenges and their causes by synthesizing and analyzing evidence from literature across multiple contexts. We undertake three systematic literature reviews across ninety-eight prominent project management, IS, and construction project journals to understand megaproject problems and blockchain’s role in addressing similar problems in supply chain and procurement in projects. We propose a conceptual framework that describes how autonomy, agency, and enactment may shape blockchain’s role as an intervention in megaprojects to help researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners build a blockchain platform for megaproject supply chains. We also provide a research agenda concerning blockchain in the megaproject supply chain using the TCCM framework.},

We examined participant behavior in a VHC for men focused on weight management and compared their weight loss through an analysis of covariance to identify mechanisms that lead to positive health outcomes and increased engagement. Participants contributed to the VHC via self-monitoring mechanisms, and we found that men engaging in self-monitoring which is individually-focused and structured are more likely to lose weight but also more transient than those engaging in unstructured self-monitoring. The reverse was found for men engaging in structured self-monitoring in a group setting, creating an interesting paradox. These results provide foundations for practical suggestions for VHCs.},

However, fostering responsible research requires understanding the comprehensive ecosystem in which research operates. Based on insights from a panel at the 2024 Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) that brought together scholars working across different levels of the research ecosystem, this paper develops a framework for understanding responsible IS research from an ecosystem perspective. We identify three interconnected sub-ecosystems (micro, meso, and macro) and describe how their stakeholders' obligations collectively influence responsible research conduct. This ecosystem view reveals both systemic barriers to responsible research practices and opportunities for positive change.},
