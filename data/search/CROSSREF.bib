   abstract                      = {Over the past three decades, user stories and use cases have become increasingly dominant systems analysis and design (SA&D) requirements techniques. Both support articulating functional requirements for software projects, although they evolved within different software development approaches—user stories from agile development and use cases from traditional software engineering—and they differ significantly in terms of their grammar, syntax, and the level of detail they can capture. As such, user stories and use cases are neither synonyms nor mutually exclusive alternatives. Rather, they can and should be complementary in the systems requirements process. Unfortunately, this mix of similarities and differences—coupled with a lack of formal standards for either—make understanding and synergistically employing user stories with use cases confusing and challenging for practitioners and students alike. To address this, this paper first provides a descriptive overview of the evolution of user stories, use cases, and their interrelationship. Second, it fills a gap in the literature by providing a prescriptive, detailed approach to employing user stories and use cases together. This prescriptive approach is illustrated via a comprehensive tutorial example, providing practitioners with actionable skills and SA&D teachers and students with a new pedagogical tool.},

   abstract                      = {Mixed-methods studies are increasing in information systems research, as they deliver robust and insightful inferences combining qualitative and quantitative research. However, there is considerable divergence in conducting such studies and reporting their findings. Therefore, we aim (1) to evaluate how mixed-methods studies have developed in information systems research under the existence of heavily used guidelines and (2) to reflect on those observations in terms of potential for future research. During our review, we identified 52 mixed-methods papers and quantitatively elaborated on the adherence to the three core concepts of mixed-methods in terms of purpose, meta-inferences, and validation. Findings discover that only eight adhere to all three of them. We discuss the significance of our results for current and upcoming mixed-methods research and derive specific suggestions for authors. With our study, we contribute to mixed-methods research by showing how to leverage the insights from existing guidelines to strengthen future research and by contributing to the discussion of the legislation associated with research guidelines, in general, presenting the status quo in current literature.},

   abstract                      = {ChatGPT, an interactive, generative artificial intelligence (AI) system, was introduced in late 2022, quickly becoming one of the most rapidly adopted technologies in history. The rapid emergence of ChatGPT and similar AI tools, such as Google’s Bard, and GPT-enabled Bing from Microsoft have led to intense discussions about how they will affect various aspects of society, including higher education. Information systems (IS) education will not escape the impact of AI tools. Our goal for this paper is to develop a better understanding of the range of possible impacts of ChatGPT on IS education and to describe how IS educators might respond to these potential impacts. To that end, we discuss challenges for IS education brought on by generative AI tools, and discuss potential future scenarios based on the emergence of such tools, ranging from AI having little impact on IS education to AI serving as competition for IS educators. We examine the challenges and consequences of each scenario. We also discuss potential responses, ranging from doing nothing to embracing AI tools as legitimate learning aids. We then provide several specific recommendations that will allow IS educators to effectively respond to the rise of AI tools.},

   abstract                      = {In developing countries such as Haiti, which are marked by high unemployment and gender inequality, online education has the potential to change lives. Returns on education are particularly high in Information Communications Technology (ICT)-intensive jobs and IT outsourcing offers opportunities for remote employment, providing alternatives for economic diversification and job creation that are particularly relevant for youth and women. However, the problem faced by many developing countries, is that traditional models, frameworks, architectures, and platforms for online learning do not lend themselves well to their context and, therefore, it is important to develop context-specific platforms. This need for suitable platforms has motivated the research question that this paper seeks to address, that is: What is the appropriate architecture that supports learning strategies for delivering scalable digital skills training in a resource-constrained environment? We propose an architecture that was developed specifically for blended learning in resource-constrained environments and describe how a prototype for this was designed, built, and deployed in Haiti. The initial responses to the application of the architecture, including the testimonials of the participants and the interest expressed by other countries of the region in adopting the proposed architecture, have been extremely positive.},

Inductive empiricism, emphasizing realism and generality, represents the received view with the classic Grounded Theory Methodology as a prime example. This paper argues for openness to theory specialization in practical disciplines such as IS. Theory specialization implies sacrificing a generality of theories for their realism and precision. The distinctive attention of the paper lies in scientific idealization, sacrificing the realism of theories for their precision and generality. It has almost been completely omitted in the literature on IS theory building. The special focus of this paper lies in IT applications as a category of IT artifacts and in design-oriented theories that provide knowledge of how to design “better” IT applications. This paper illustrates its points using TAM/UTAUT research.},

We recognize security risks and present the use of a blockchain database as a representative means of securely managing and controlling an individual’s PHI. Data collected from a nationally representative sample of allergy sufferers indicate that the health belief model strongly predicts willingness to share PHI on a personalized AI-supported platform.

By combining a historical review of the literature with a content analysis of 30 years of underground hacker communication, we show that hacking has evolved in three waves to embrace learning and creativity, intrusion and crime, as well as politics and cyberwarfare. We uncover a paradoxical relationship between hackers and society at large where underground hacking is considered a digital crime while at the same time inspiring and driving corporate innovation, cybersecurity, and even cyberwarfare. The outcome of our research provides a nuanced picture of the hacker underground by highlighting differences between competing discursive themes across time. Moreover, by translating these themes into a set of six contrasting personas of IS professionals, we discuss how knowledge, technologies, and creative practices of underground hackers are being professionalized. We use this discussion to provide implications and a research agenda for IS studies in cybersecurity, innovation, and cyberwarfare.},

This study examines HCT in a larger context where it is used as a tool to improve public health. The objective is to examine how HCT is used to monitor Covid-19’s spread, and how social factors affect individual assessment of HCT and individual compliance disposition of Covid-19 guidelines. Analyzing data collected from 360 HCT users suggests that the information and system quality of HCT indeed impact users’ assessment of its effectiveness and their compliance disposition. However, such effects are strongly mediated by social factors: peer influence and government trust can sway an individual’s cognitive judgments of Covid-19 regardless of HCT’s impacts. The findings highlight the importance of social factors in pandemic management and the need to socialize health informatics to make them more effective.},

AgriMitr was established by the founder and CEO of KTD, Dr. Jishu Bose, to develop products using satellite imagery and data science. AgriMitr developed a mobile and web application that helped farmers and other key stakeholders understand crop health, soil fertility and other critical factors related to agriculture by machine learning algorithms using satellite images. The app was a major leap of innovation in the Indian Agri-Tech space. The app was to be used majorly by farmers based in rural India, and thus the major challenge lay in spreading awareness, adoption, and usage of the app. The app, if appropriately deployed, would be an imminent milestone in sustainable food production and consumption and can aid in taking a step forward in solving the world hunger problem, an SDG of the UN. Dr. Bose was planning the strategy for AgriMitr’s mass adoption and implementation with the help of Mr. Madhav A. Ram. The much-awaited meeting with investors and key stakeholders was just one week away. Madhav, under the guidance of Dr. Bose, had to prepare a roadmap and his game plan for the next year to bring this wave of change and large-scale digital adoption among the farmers of India.},

Drawing on technology affordance and media synchronicity frameworks, we explore how the existence of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) and differences in usage patterns due to a patient’s generation impact these relationships. Utilizing HINTS data, this study provides empirical support for a positive relationship between the utilization of electronic personal health records (e-PHRs) and healthcare quality perceptions, albeit with a caveat that patients with greater healthcare needs as well as millennial and younger generations do not seem to enjoy the same benefits from increased use of e-PHRs. Furthermore, asynchronous patient-provider electronic communication is yet to achieve positive perceptions of better healthcare quality for most users. This research bears implications for the personalization and customization of OHMT to account for variations in patient’s healthcare needs and usage patterns.},

The utilization of collective intelligence (CI) via web-based platforms is a promising approach for addressing such wicked problems. The management of these information systems would benefit from evidence-based decision support regarding facilitation and improvement efforts. However, to date, there is no suitable model to guide such efforts. Existing approaches address specific applications or cover certain assessment areas but do not provide a holistic perspective. Meanwhile, research offers substantial insights into best practices for addressing wicked problems and running CI applications. This paper develops an assessment model comprising five central success dimensions for information systems that address wicked problems. Their subdimensions and associated measurement metrics allow for evidence-driven facilitation and improvement of CI applications for wicked problems. Apart from the model’s capability to improve future runs and processes, it also offers the potential to provide immediate insights for facilitation efforts during runtime. The model was validated with a platform dealing with the assessment of risks presented by global climate change. This evaluation generated strong evidence for the model’s applicability and usefulness.},

Then, drawing on the experiential learning perspective, we propose how conjoint experiential learning (CEL) can enhance sustainable agricultural practices by enhancing both AI and human learning and overcoming roadblocks in using AgriDSS.

Small-scale farmers in low-income countries are especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend heavily on rain, seasonality patterns, and known temperature ranges. Prioritizing the efforts of building climate change resilience and adaptive capacity for small-scale farmers is essential in achieving Sustainable Development Goals 13, 1, and 2. An important first step towards those efforts is to assess the climate change vulnerability among the population. We propose a Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Framework Design Framework (CCVA-DF) to guide the design of innovative digital CCVA solutions to enhance the adaptive capacity and climate change resilience of small-scale farmers. The framework outlines modern methods for vulnerability data collection and processing through Remote Sensing and GIS, advanced spatial analysis and modeling for measuring vulnerabilities, and visual analytics to support decision-making in the planning and implementation of suitable interventions. The framework is instantiated into a web application that is used by a real-world organization for transforming household resilience in Western Honduras. The CCVA-DF showcases novel measures of vulnerability using geospatial technology. It provides guidelines to design digital vulnerability assessment tools that can be used by researchers and practitioners worldwide to tackle climate change challenges.},
